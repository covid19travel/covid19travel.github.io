  International Restrictions: <br>
 *All travellers: All individuals 2 years old or older travelling to Venezuela must present either of the following at port of origin:<br>
•        proof of COVID-19 vaccination.<br>
•        a negative COVID-19 PCR-RT test performed within 72 hours of arrival<br>
For a proof of COVID-19 vaccination to be considered valid, at least 14 calendar days must have passed since your last vaccine dose of a complete vaccination scheme (for both 2-dose or 1-dose vaccines). If more than 270 days have passed since your last dose of a complete vaccination scheme, proof of a vaccine booster is required.<br>
All individuals 5 years old or older must take a further COVID-19 PCR-RT test at port of entry at Maiquetia International Airport, to be administered by a service provider designated by local health authorities -<a href=""https://pasedesalud.casalab.com.ve/"">CasaLab</a>.<br>
Travellers must sign-up in advance through the provider’s website -<a href=""https://pasedesalud.casalab.com.ve/"">CasaLab</a>, and register their incoming flight details in order to obtain a QR code. This QR code (hardcopy or digital) will be requested by both the airline/carrier upon check-in and by local sanitary authorities on arrival for the test to be administered.<br>
Most airlines have already included the fee for this arrival PCR-RT test within the cost of the travellers’ ticket. Where the carrier has not included this fee in your ticket, each passenger will have to cover its cost at their own expense: USD $60 (United States dollars) payable on arrival in cash only. The airline/carrier might request for the traveller to prove (show) having this amount of currency in cash during check-in.<br>
The service provider (<a href=""https://pasedesalud.casalab.com.ve/"">CasaLab</a>) will share your test results and personal details with the authorities in Venezuela. If you test positive for COVID-19, you must follow instructions from the local health authorities. There are no mandatory rules in respect to quarantine.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.<br>
*If you’re fully vaccinated: If you’re fully vaccinated you must comply with the rules set out above.<br>
*Proof of vaccination status: Proof of COVID-19 vaccination is required for check-in at port of origin.

Please note that proof of vaccination might be required to allow entry to some indoor venues such as restaurants and cafes.<br>
*If you’re not fully vaccinated: Individuals who are not fully vaccinated may use, alternatively, a negative COVID-19 PCR-RT test performed within 72 hours of arrival as a substitute for proof of vaccination. <br>
