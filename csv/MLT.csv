Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Travel in Malta: It is not mandatory to wear a face mask inside, outside or on public transportation. <br>
*Public spaces and services: It is not mandatory to wear a face mask outside or inside, although it is at the discretion of individual establishments to ask customers to present a valid vaccination certificate or to wear a face mask. <br>
 Malta will accept the  COVID vaccine certification (both the digital and letter versions) as proof of your vaccination status. Digital certificates must include a verifiable 2D barcode (QR code). If you are travelling with a printed proof of vaccination status, it must date from 1 November to ensure that the certificate can be scanned successfully. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
If you are resident in Malta and have a Maltese-issued vaccination certificate, the validity of your certificate is as follows: <br>
•        The certificate is valid for 3 months from the date of the second dose (or the first dose for Jannsen / Johnson and Johnson vaccine) <br>
•        The certificate is valid for 9 months from the date of the third dose (booster vaccination) <br>
For vaccination certificates issued outside of Malta, the validity of that certificate will apply. <br>

*If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
