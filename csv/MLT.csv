Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Travel in Malta: Passengers on public transport, including the Gozo ferry and clients of commercial entities must wear face masks. <br>
Public spaces and services: It is mandatory to wear a face mask in all indoor public spaces (children under 3 are exempt). Masks are not required in outdoor public spaces. <br>
Presentation of a valid vaccination certificate, for those aged 12 and over, is mandatory for entry into bars, nighclubs, casinos, gaming parlours and bingo halls.<br>
There is a limit of 8 people per table in hospitality establishments. Masks are to be worn inside, unless seated and eating or drinking.
If you live in England, Scotland, Northern Ireland or Wales, Malta will accept the  COVID vaccine certification (both the digital and letter versions) as proof of your vaccination status. Digital certificates must include a verifiable 2D barcode (QR code). Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
If you are resident in Malta and have a Maltese-issued vaccination certificate, the validity of your certificate is as follows: <br>
•        The certificate is valid for 3 months from the date of the second dose (or the first dose for Jannsen / Johnson and Johnson vaccine) <br>
•        The certificate is valid for 9 months from the date of the third dose (booster vaccination) <br>
For vaccination certificates issued outside of Malta, the validity of that certificate will apply. <br>
Full details of <a href=""https://legislation.mt/eli/ln/2020/402/eng/pdf"">exemptions from mask wearing  </a> are available online. Medical exemptions must be certified by a medical professional. <br>
Full information is available on the <a href=""https://deputyprimeminister.gov.mt/en/health-promotion/covid-19/Pages/mitigation-conditions-and-guidances.aspx"">Maltese government coronavirus advice page</a>
*If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
