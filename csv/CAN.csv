You must follow the handout given to you at time of entry, as well as all additional federal, provincial/territorial and local public health measures, including wearing a well-constructed mask en route to your place of quarantine. If you have symptoms or an unsuitable quarantine plan, follow the directions provided by the government representative. <br>
Dependents 18 years of age or over who are unvaccinated because of mental or physical limitation may enter but must follow all testing and quarantine requirements, even when they are accompanied by parents or guardians who qualify as a fully vaccinated traveller. <br>
Children aged 5 -11, who are accompanied by a <a href=""https://travel.gc.ca/travel-covid/travel-restrictions/covid-vaccinated-travellers-entering-canada?utm_source=digital-engagement-toolkit&utm_medium=email&utm_content=vaccinated-en&utm_campaign=phac-dek-sept-2021#determine-fully"">fully vaccinated</a> parent, step-parent, guardian or tutor, are no longer required to complete a pre-entry COVID-19 test for entry to Canada.<br>
Canadian citizens (including dual citizens), people registered under the Indian Act, permanent residents of Canada, or protected persons (refugee status) are allowed to enter Canada if not fully vaccinated. <br>
Further information about unvaccinated travellers entering Canada during COVID-19 is available on the <a href=""https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/unvaccinated-travellers-entering-canada-covid-19.html"">Public Health Agency of Canada’s website</a>.

*If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year: If you’ve recovered from COVID-19, you still need at least 2 doses of an accepted COVID-19 vaccine, a mix of 2 accepted vaccines or 1 dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine to enter Canada for discretionary (non-essential) purposes. <br>
If you’ve only had one dose of an accepted vaccine other than Janssen (Johnson & Johnson), you don’t qualify for the fully vaccinated traveller exemption. <br>
*Children and young people: Children aged 12 to 17 years must follow the rules for fully vaccinated travellers to enter Canada. Unvaccinated and partially vaccinated children aged 12 to 17 are subject to the 14-day quarantine, and all testing requirements for pre-entry, arrival and Day-8 tests, whether or not they are accompanied by travellers who qualify as a fully vaccinated traveller. <br>
Unvaccinated asymptomatic travellers 12 years of age and over are not required to quarantine upon entering Canada if they meet have a medical contraindication against getting a COVID-19 vaccine and comply with certain measures. See <a href=""https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/awareness-resources/travellers-over-12-without-symptoms-medically-exempt-vaccination.html"">Public Health Canada’s website for further information</a>.
Unvaccinated or partially vaccinated children aged 11 and under accompanied by a partially vaccinated or unvaccinated adult must complete pre-entry, arrival and Day-8 tests, unless you have evidence that the child had a positive COVID-19 test taken 14 to 180 days prior to arrival in Canada or the child is aged 4 and under. There are additional rules that must be followed for the first 14 days of their visit, such as not attending school and limiting contact with others. Further details are available on the  <a href=""https://travel.gc.ca/travel-covid/travel-restrictions/covid-vaccinated-travellers-entering-canada#children"">Government of Canada’s travel pages</a>.
If you qualify as a fully vaccinated traveller, your unvaccinated or partially vaccinated children aged 11 and under will be exempt from taking a pre-departure test and quarantine, without any limitations on their activities, and are no longer required to produce a quarantine plan. This means, for example, they no longer need to wait 14 days before attending school, camp or day care. <br>
Adults travelling with fully vaccinated children between the ages of 5 to 11 have the option to upload their proof of vaccination into ArriveCAN.<br>
The benefit of uploading the child’s proof is that if they are travelling with an adult who does not qualify as fully vaccinated, the child will qualify for an exemption from quarantine and mandatory testing on Day 1 and Day 8. <br>

*If you’re transiting through Canada: You may be permitted to transit through Canada to reach another country. If you are transiting through Canada, you must obtain an Electronic Travel Authorisation (eTA), unless you are otherwise exempted (for example, if you have a valid Canadian visa or a permanent resident card). You must also: <br>
•        plan your travel so you arrive and depart from the same Canadian airport within 24 hours. Domestic transfers are not permitted <br>
•        make sure your baggage is checked through to a destination outside of Canada <br>

•        Montréal-Trudeau (YUL) <br>
•        Calgary International (YYC) <br>

During your connection you must remain in the secure transit area to complete your connection. This means that you will not be allowed to collect your baggage, or check-in for your next flight anywhere but at your scheduled gate of departure. <br>
You are exempt from testing and quarantine requirements, as long as you remain in the se-cure transit area to complete your connection within 24 hours. If you need to leave the airport or the secure transit area due to a flight cancellation or delay, you become subject to mandatory quarantine until your flight departs. <br>
You must follow all flight requirements and comply with any guidelines provided by the Airport Authority, such as wearing a face mask. If you cannot wear a face mask for medical reasons, you must be in possession of a medical certificate. <br>
Further information about transiting through Canada can be found on the <a href=""https://travel.gc.ca/travel-covid/travel-restrictions/border"">Transit through Canada webpage</a>. If you have any further questions, you should contact your airline,

 <br>
 <br> 
  Internal Restrictions:<br> 
*Travel in Canada: To help curb the spread of coronavirus, provincial governments have introduced a number of measures. There are some regional variations, but they generally include:
•        limit on numbers in bars and restaurants and at large gatherings in affected cities and regions <br>
•        mandatory wearing of face masks in certain indoor public settings <br>
*Public spaces and services: Travellers aged 12 and above must be fully vaccinated to depart from Canadian airports on both domestic and international flights, or travel on VIA Rail and Rocky Mountaineer trains. There are very limited exceptions. Non-medical face masks or face coverings are required for all flights to and from Canadian airports, and within airport terminals. Anyone who cannot wear a face mask for medical reasons must be in possession of a medical certificate. The Canadian authorities recommend the use of non-medical masks/facial coverings when it is not possible to consistently maintain a 2-metre physical distance from others, including on public transportation. Some local transport authorities are making this a mandatory requirement. You should ensure that you are in possession of a mask/facial covering when using public transport in the event you are requested by transport operators to wear one. <br>
Federal, provincial and local authorities may introduce further restrictions at short notice, including the requirement to wear a face mask or face covering in public or enclosed spaces, closing provincial borders, internal travel restrictions, a provisional ban on temporary foreign workers, or mandatory self-isolation for people arriving from other provinces. You should comply with the rules and advice of local authorities in relation to coronavirus. Check <a href=""https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/symptoms/provincial-territorial-resources-covid-19.html"">guidance for each province</a>.
*If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
