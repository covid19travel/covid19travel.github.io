 <br> 
  Internal Restrictions:<br> 
*Travel in Canada: To help curb the spread of coronavirus, provincial governments have introduced a number of measures. There are some regional variations, but they generally include: <br>
•        a ban on large social gatherings, where physical distancing is not possible<br>
•        closure of some public facilities, museums, cinemas and theatres in affected cities and regions<br>
•        curfew or closure of bars and restaurants in affected cities and regions<br>
•        some public transport offering only a limited service<br>
•        mandatory wearing of face masks in indoor public settings <br>
*Public spaces and services: Anyone showing symptoms associated with coronavirus will be barred from domestic flights and some inter-city train services. Non-medical face masks or face coverings are required for all flights to and from Canadian airports, and within airport terminals. Anyone who cannot wear a face mask for medical reasons must be in possession of a medical certificate. <br>
The Canadian authorities recommend the use of non-medical masks/facial coverings when it is not possible to consistently maintain a 2-metre physical distance from others, including on public transportation. Some local transport authorities are making this a mandatory requirement. You should ensure that you are in possession of a mask/facial covering when using public transport in the event you are requested by transport operators to wear one. <br>
Federal, provincial and local authorities may introduce further restrictions at short notice, including the requirement to wear a face mask or face covering in public or enclosed spaces, closing provincial borders, internal travel restrictions, a provisional ban on temporary foreign workers, or mandatory self-isolation for people arriving from other provinces. You should comply with the rules and advice of local authorities in relation to coronavirus. <br>
