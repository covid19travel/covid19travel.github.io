International Restrictions: <br>
*All travellers: In general, Foreign citizens do not need a visa to transit or enter Singapore. It’s up to <a href=""https://www.ica.gov.sg/"">Immigration and Checkpoints Authority</a> to decide who can enter Singapore. <br>
All arrivals in Singapore must complete an electronic <a href=""https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/sgarrivalcard/"">SG Arrival Card</a> up to three days before entry into Singapore. This online form requires travel details and a health declaration. It is illegal to submit a false declaration. <br
If you’re arriving from certain countries in Africa and Latin America, 
<a href=""https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-depart/entry_requirements/yellow-fever-vaccination-certificate""> you may need to show a yellow fever certificate to enter Singapore</a>.
There are other measures in place for foreign crew working on ships, small vessels, or pleasure crafts at one of Singapore’s marinas. See 
<a href=""https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/arriving/overview#crew"">guidelines for air/sea crew and pleasure craft owners</a> . Check with your employer or agent for any specific COVID-19 rules at the marina. <br>
Singapore has strict rules on: <br>
•        wearing masks on public transport and in healthcare settings <br>
•        being fully vaccinated to dine out, attend an event with over 500 people and enter some nightlife venues <br>
•        testing, self-isolation and quarantine, whenever these are required <br>
If you test positive for COVID-19 you are required to defer your travel to Singapore until at least 72 hours after you test negative, or, for those who continue to test positive, for at least 7 days for vaccinated people and at least 14 days for unvaccinated people. <br>
Breaking these rules can lead to a lengthy investigation, fines, or a prison sentence.  <br>
*If you’re fully vaccinated: To enter Singapore you must be fully vaccinated and have digital or physical copies of your vaccination status. If you are not vaccinated, see the entry requirements for unvaccinated people below. <br>
Children aged 12 years and under who are unvaccinated but travelling with fully-vaccinated parents or guardians can enter Singapore. This includes children turning 12 years old in 2022. <br>
If you’re fully vaccinated and you’ve recovered from COVID-19 in the past three months, you may be exempt from taking COVID-19 tests. See the <a href=""https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-transit-depart"">ICA</a>  website for complete information. <br>
What happens if you test positive for COVID-19
You’ll need to self-isolate at the hotel or home you’re staying in. What happens next will depend on whether you’re well or unwell. See <a href=""https://ask.gov.sg/agency/moh?topics=I%20am%20a%20traveller%20to%20Singapore"">Ask MOH</a>. Breaking self-isolation or quarantine orders is an offence. <br>
*Proof of vaccination status: You must show proof that you have been fully vaccinated to enter Singapore. <br>
Singapore will accept the proof of COVID-19 vaccination record. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
If you’re on a short-term pass in Singapore, you are asked to 
<a href=""https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg/"">download the TraceTogether app</a> or 
<a href=""https://support.tracetogether.gov.sg/hc/en-sg/articles/900007673943-Are-travellers-required-to-use-TraceTogether-TT-during-their-stay-in-Singapore"">buy a TraceTogether token</a> to scan in and out of public venues. <br>
*If you’re not fully vaccinated: Until 29 August if you are not fully vaccinated you cannot enter Singapore unless you are a Singapore Citizen or Permanent Resident. From 29 August unvaccinated people will be able to enter Singapore for short-term visits but must show a negative pre-departure COVID-19 test result that was conducted or supervised by healthcare professionals, and that was completed within two days before travel. COVID-19 travel insurance of a minimum cover of S$30,000 is also compulsory and proof of insurance must be shown. For details, visit the <a href=""https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-transit-depart"">ICA website</a>.
*Children and young people: Children born on or after 1 January 2010 (i.e. aged 12 and below by year of birth) are exempted from COVID-19 border measures. See Singapore’s <a href=""https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-transit-depart"">ICA website</a> for full guidelines. <br>
*If you’re transiting through Singapore: Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination. Check with your airline if it has approval to transit through Singapore. <br>
Passengers transiting Changi Airport for less than 24 hours and not entering Singapore are not required to have proof of vaccination or tests, and are also not required to complete any entry approval measures. You do not need a visa for an airside transit in Singapore. <br>
More information about transiting through Singapore can be found on the <a href=""https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-transit-depart/transiting-singapore"">Transiting through Singapore</a>   page of the ICA website. <br>

 <br>
 Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Travel in Singapore: See the <a href=""https://www.gov.sg/"">Singapore Government website</a> for the latest on the COVID-19 situation and measures in place to curb its spread. <br>
If you do not comply with these measures you could be fined, imprisoned, or both, then deported. Repeat offenders will face further fines and/or prosecution. Be aware that restrictions and penalties are subject to change at short notice.<br>
*Public spaces and services:<br>
Face masks: From 29 August 2022 face masks will only be compulsory on public transport, in care homes and inside healthcare facilities, including dentists and clinics. Facemasks will remain required in the queuing areas to board public transport, such as on train platforms and in bus queues, but will not be required inside airports, taxis and privately hired buses. At healthcare facilities all indoor locations, including shops and restaurants contained inside, require masks to be worn at all times, except when eating or drinking. Children under 6 years old do not need to wear masks. You could be fined, imprisoned, or both if you are found not wearing a face mask when it is required. <br>
The Health Sciences Authority’s <a href=""https://www.hsa.gov.sg/consumer-safety/articles/what-you-need-to-know-about-masks"">guide on face masks</a> recommends that masks have at least 2 to 3 layers of fabric. <br>
