 <br>
 Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Travel in Singapore: See the <a href=""https://www.gov.sg/"">Singapore Government website  < /a> for the latest on the COVID-19 situation and measures in place to curb its spread. <br>
If you do not comply with these measures you could be fined, imprisoned, or both, then deported. Repeat offenders will face further fines and/or prosecution. Be aware that restrictions and penalties are subject to change at short notice. <br>
*Public spaces and services: <br>
Face masks: You must wear a face mask indoors and on public transport (wearing a mask outdoors is optional from 29 March 2022 onwards). Partly open-air hawker centres and ‘coffee shops’ are regarded as indoor venues that require mask wearing. Some exceptions are: children under 6 years old; anyone eating, drinking or taking medication; or anyone engaged in strenuous exercise. You could be fined, imprisoned, or both if you are found not wearing a face mask without a valid reason. <br>
The Health Sciences Authority’s <a href=""https://www.hsa.gov.sg/consumer-safety/articles/what-you-need-to-know-about-masks"">guide on face masks</a>  recommends that masks have at least 2 to 3 layers of fabric. <br>
Trace Together and Health Alerts via SMS: You’ll need to scan in and out of many places using the Trace Together <a href=""https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg/"">phone app or token</a>. TraceTogether and fully vaccinated status is required to enter public places including: <br>
public buildings, shopping centres and malls, schools, workplaces and places of worship. <br>
Short term foreign visitors must download the TraceTogether app on their phones and activate it while in Singapore. Mobile phones and/or local tourist SIM cards can be rented/purchased at Changi Airport to enable visitors to do so. <br>
TraceTogether tokens can be rented for children aged 7-12 or those with disabilities. See the <a href=""https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/health/tt-for-travellers"">TraceTogether for Travellers page</a> on the <a href=""https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/"">SafeTravel website</a> for complete information. If you are identified as a close contact of a confirmed case as part of this contract tracing system, you may receive a health alert via SMS and need to be tested. It is a legal requirement to follow the COVID-19 instructions given to you by the Singapore government. <br>
Vaccination status: To enter most public places, anyone over 12 years old must be recognised as fully vaccinated by the Singapore government’s definition. You’re considered fully vaccinated 14 days after you’ve completed the required doses of any of these vaccines: <br>
•        Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca (also known as CoviShield), Janssen (Johnson and Johnson), Sinovac, Sinopharm, Covaxin, Novavax
You’ll need to show your TraceTogether app or token as proof of vaccination before being allowed to enter. <br> 
Singapore’s Vaccine Booster Programme includes those 12 years old and above. If you are resident in Singapore, or have stayed in Singapore for a month, and fail to get your booster shot within 270 days after your final dose of the primary series you will lose your fully-vaccinated status. <br>
If you’re not fully vaccinated, you will not be able to enter shopping malls or public attractions, visit someone in hospital, or to dine or drink in restaurants, hawker centres, cafes or bars. <br>
Quarantine and home recovery: If you test positive for COVID-19, you will initially be required to isolate at your hotel or residential accommodation. Instructions on what to do next depend on whether you are well or unwell. Details are on Singapore’s <a href=""https://www.covid.gov.sg/"">Living with COVID-19</a> page. <br>
Work: Offices can have up to 75% staff capacity from 29 March 2022 onwards. Social gatherings at work are allowed for groups of up to ten people. Social distancing rules still apply. If you are unvaccinated, you are not allowed to go into work at all. Vaccination is required to obtain or renew a long-term pass, work pass or Permanent Residency. <br>
Details on workplace matters are under <a href=""https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19"">Advisories on COVID-19 </a> on the <a href=""https://www.mom.gov.sg/"">Ministry of Manpower  </a> website. <br>
Social gatherings and dining out rules from 29 March onwards. <br>
When meeting up with friends or family: <br>
•        keep group sizes to a maximum of ten people, even at events where masks are worn (up to 30 people can play sports together in some settings) <br>
•        a maximum of ten different people (‘unique visitors’) can visit you at home at any one time <br>
•        a maximum of ten people can dine out at restaurants together if they are fully vaccinated and can provide the necessary proof of vaccination (a maximum of five vaccinated people can dine together in venues that do not require vaccination status to be shown on entry) <br>
•        In settings where masks are not being worn, such as at meals, different groups of people should keep a distance of one metre from each other <br>
If safe distancing is not possible - while on public transport, for example - avoid speaking to each other or talking on the phone. <br>
