You could be fined, imprisoned, or both if you are found not wearing a face mask without a valid reason. The Health Sciences Authority’s<a href=""https://www.hsa.gov.sg/consumer-safety/articles/what-you-need-to-know-about-masks"">guide on face masks</a> recommends that masks have at least 2 to 3 layers of fabric.<br>

You are considered fully vaccinated 14 days after you’ve completed the required doses of these vaccines: Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca (CoviShield), Janssen (Johnson and Johnson), Sinovac or Sinopharm. You will need to show proof of vaccination status before being allowed to enter. The TraceTogether app or token can be used to prove vaccination status. If you are not fully vaccinated you will not be able to enter shopping malls or public attractions, or to dine or drink in restaurants, hawker centres, cafes or bars. <br>
*Quarantine and home recovery: If you’re a close contact of someone who has tested positive, you may be required to take a test.

•        two different people (‘unique visitors’) can visit you at home in one day<br>
•        two people can dine out together if they are fully vaccinated<br>
•        a maximum of two people from different households can take a taxi or private hire car together, but people from the same household can travel in bigger groups. <br>
