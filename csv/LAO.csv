  International Restrictions: 
 *Entry to Laos: The government of the Lao PDR has suspended the visa on arrival service at all international entry points. No visas are being issued to people travelling from a country with cases of COVID-19, including the UK. However, the Lao authorities may consider granting special entry permission for foreigners (experts, technicians and foreign nationals that are needed for essential projects) who wish to come to Laos.
 Entry procedures for Laos visa-holders:<br>
 - all foreigners must present a Certificate of Entry (issued by the MFA); a completed Health Declaration form; and a ‘Fit to Fly’ Certificate issued no more than 72 hours prior to travel. You should arrange to take a private test.
 - all arrivals will be subject to a COVID-19 test at their own expense. Positive cases will be admitted to hospital for treatment.
 - all negative cases have to undergo 14 days quarantine at designated locations (with all expenses covered by individuals or their organisations/companies). <br>
 Due to the impacts of coronavirus the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will continue to extend visas in country and be flexible if visas cannot be extended before the due date for operational reasons because of the new regulations.<br>
 *Screening on arrival: There is compulsory testing for COVID-19 on arrival in Laos at your own expense. Those testing positive will be admitted to hospital for treatment.
 Enhanced health screening is in place and border crossings between Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam are closed. You should allow additional time to include this possibility and check with your airline if travelling by air.
 Anybody travelling to Laos with a fever, cough or difficulty breathing, and a travel history from coronavirus affected countries, will be isolated in hospital and tested. The hospitals being used are Mittaphab, Mahosot, Setthathirath and the National Military Hospital (103).<br>
 *Quarantine requirements: All arrivals testing negative for COVID-19 will have to undergo 14 days quarantine at designated locations, which include hotels (with all expenses covered by individuals or their organisations/companies).<br>
 *Testing on departure: There is no compulsory COVID testing on departure from Laos. You should check all conditions of air ticket purchases carefully with airlines as some may need evidence of a negative COVID test to travel.<br>
