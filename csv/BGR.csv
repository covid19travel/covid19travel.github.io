*Public spaces and services: The Emergency Epidemic situation ended on 31 March 2022. Various coronavirus measures and restrictions have changed. The police are strictly enforcing measures and failure to comply could result in a fine.<br>
If you test positive for COVID-19, you will be required to self-isolate for 10 days. Additionally, there is a mandatory 7-day self-isolation requirement (starting from the date of last contact with the infected person) for anyone who has been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19, regardless of vaccination status. During self-isolation you are not permitted to leave Bulgaria. <br>
The 7-day mandatory self-isolation period for close contacts may be revoked for close contacts who are vaccinated with a booster dose and who present a negative PCR test taken 72 hours after the mandatory self-isolation period commenced. The mandatory self-isolation requirement is revoked from the day after the registration of the negative result. Results will automatically be registered by the test centre when they produce the result certificate. <br>
Wearing a face mask is no longer mandatory in all indoor public spaces. However, mask-wearing remains highly recommended in hospitals, public transport and other crowded areas. The rule regarding maintaining a social distance of at least 1.5 metres is no longer in place. It is no longer necessary to present a COVID vaccination certificate to visit indoor venues. <br>

Road: Restrictions apply at many European land borders, including with Bulgaria, which affect road and rail travel. You should check the travel advice for any countries through which you are considering travel before you depart.<br>
