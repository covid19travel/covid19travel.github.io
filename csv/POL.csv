Internal Restrictions: <br> 
*Public spaces and services: The Polish government has strict sanitary rules and restrictions in place nationwide. Tighter restrictions are in place in some regions until 1 May. The <a href=""https://www.gov.pl/web/koronawirus/aktualne-zasady-i-ograniczenia"">Polish Government’s website</a> (in Polish) explains which regions have tighter rules. Facemasks are compulsory in open public spaces across Poland until 15 May, apart from parks, forests and National Parks. Children under 4 are not required to wear facemasks. If there are medical reasons why you cannot wear a facemask, you must carry a doctor’s note with you explaining this. Bandanas, scarves, balaclavas and visors are not permitted alternatives to facemasks. Your mouth and nose must be covered. When outside, you should keep a 1.5 metre distance from others, unless you are a parent with a child under 13 or the carer of a disabled person. <br>
You must also wear a facemask at all times in enclosed spaces, on public transport, in taxis or in an open space where you are unable to maintain a 1.5 metre distance. You do not need to wear a facemask in a private car. Police and sanitary inspectors are entitled to issue you with an on-the-spot fine (approximately PLN500) if you are found not to be wearing a facemask when you should. Further prosecution could result in a fine of up to PLN 30,000 for failing to follow sanitary rules. <br>
Public gatherings are limited to 5 people, excluding households bigger than 5 members and workplaces. Private gatherings may include no more than 5 people, excluding household members. Outdoor gatherings, celebrations and events are planned to be allowed for up to 25 people from 15 May, and both outdoor and indoor events for up to 50 people from 29 May. There are restrictions on the number of people attending religious services and funerals and you should contact religious venues for more information.<br>
Public transport is operating with 50% capacity seating to maintain appropriate distance between passengers. You can still use taxis. Facemasks must be worn at all times. <br>
Cultural institutions such as museums, art galleries and cultural centres plan to re-open 4 May. Outdoor theatres, opera houses and cinemas plan to re-open 15 May (with maximum 50% audience capacity), with indoor theatres and cinemas planning to open 29 May (with maximum 50% audience capacity). Libraries are open with strict sanitary procedures in place. National Forests, parks and beaches are open. <br>
Non-essential shops in shopping malls and retail parks including large DIY, homeware and furniture shops are closed until 4 May (supermarkets and pharmacies remain open). Customer numbers are limited in shops. This might mean you have to queue for entry. In all areas of Poland a facemask must be worn inside shops and hand sanitiser must be used where provided. <br>
Petrol stations, car washes and car/motorbike repair centres remain open. Banks, insurance providers and post offices also remain open. Restaurants, cafes and pubs are closed, and can only provide a takeaway/delivery service. From 15 May they plan to partially re-open (outdoor terraces only) and from 29 May re-open indoors and outdoors (maximum 50% capacity). <br>
Open air sport facilities and grounds are open for up to 25 people and plan to open for up to 50 people from 01 May. Children and young people may take part in sports activities run by sporting associations. Indoor sporting venues (including swimming pools) are reserved for professionals only and will only open to children and young people in organised groups from 01 May (maximum 50% capacity). Indoor swimming pools plan to open for everyone (up to 50% capacity) from 29 May. Outdoor sports venues plan to allow audiences (up to 25% of normally permitted numbers) from 15 May. <br>
Gyms, fitness clubs and saunas plan to re-open 29 May with limits on how many people can attend at the same time. Hairdressers and beauty salons are open in some regions from 26 April and will fully re-open in all regions from 01 May. <br>
Administrative offices may open with limited numbers inside at any one time. You might find some offices are only open by appointment and you are recommended to check websites or contact the office before travelling as appointments may be limited. <br>
The above national measures may be extended further, in scope and time, at short notice. Some regions may have stricter rules in place. See <a href=""https://www.gov.pl/web/koronawirus/aktualne-zasady-i-ograniczenia"">here</a> (in Polish) for details of any regions with stricter rules. <br>
*Road and air travel: You can enter and depart Poland by car or coach over some land border crossings, though the situation could change quickly. Countries neighbouring Poland may introduce border restrictions at short notice.  Coach services are available between London and Poland (journey times are in excess of 24 hours including channel crossing). <br> 
Flights between the UK and Poland are operating. Routes, carriers and availability vary and are based on demand.<br>
*Accommodation: Hotels are closed until 8 May, except for business trips and to accommodate workers.
