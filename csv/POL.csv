Internal Restrictions: <br> 
*Travel by road: You can enter and depart Poland by car or coach over some land border crossings, though the situation could change quickly. Countries neighbouring Poland may introduce border restrictions at short notice. Check country specific travel advice for any country that you plan to transit during your journey. <br>
The Kuzniсa-Bruzgi road border crossing is currently closed, and more border checkpoints may close or implement restrictions at short notice. Coach services are available between London and Poland (journey times are in excess of 24 hours including Channel crossing).
*Public spaces and services: The Polish government has strict sanitary rules and restrictions in place nationwide. Further guidance can be found on the <a href=""https://www.gov.pl/web/coronavirus"">Polish government website</a>. Further national or regional measures may be implemented at short notice. <br>
Facemasks are compulsory in indoor and enclosed spaces, on public transport, in taxis or in an open space where you are unable to maintain a 1.5 metre distance. You do not need to wear a facemask in a private car. Children under 4 are not required to wear facemasks. If there are medical reasons why you cannot wear a facemask, you must carry a doctor’s note with you explaining this. Bandanas, scarves, balaclavas and visors are not permitted alternatives to facemasks. Your mouth and nose must be covered. <br>
When outside, you should keep a 1.5 metre distance from others, unless you are in the same household, a parent with a child under 13 or the carer of a person with a disability or special needs. <br>
Police and sanitary inspectors are entitled to issue you with an on-the-spot fine (approximately PLN500) if you are found not to be wearing a facemask when you should. Further prosecution could result in a fine of up to PLN 30,000 for failing to follow sanitary rules. <br>
Public transport is operating with a maximum limit of 75% capacity. Gatherings, celebrations and events are allowed for up to 100 people. Fairs, exhibitions, conferences and trade events are required to have a maximum of one person per 15 square metres. <br>
Sports events, religious services and funerals have a maximum limit of 30% capacity. These limits can be increased, but only to those who can provide evidence they are fully vaccinated to venue staff. <br>
Museums, galleries, cultural centres, libraries, theatres, cinemas and operas, swimming pools and aqua parks have a maximum limit of 30% capacity. These limits can be increased, but only to those who can provide evidence they are fully vaccinated to venue staff. <br>
All nightclubs, discos and venues with dancefloors are closed. National Forests, parks and beaches are open. Outside leisure and sport facilities are open with limits on capacity. <br>
Gyms, fitness clubs, hairdressers, beauty salons and saunas are open with strict hygiene rules and limits on numbers. Gyms, fitness clubs and indoor games facilities have a limit of one person per 15 square metres. <br>
All shops and services are open. Customer numbers are limited in shops. This might mean you have to queue for entry at busy times. In all areas of Poland a facemask must be worn inside shops and hand sanitiser must be used where provided. <br>
Administrative offices may open with limited numbers inside at any one time. You might find some offices are only open by appointment or have restrictions on in-person attendance and you are recommended to check websites or contact the office before travelling as appointments may be limited. <br>
Poland will accept the proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
*Accommodation: Hotels are currently open with a 30% capacity limit. These limits can be increased, but only to those who can provide evidence they are fully vaccinated. <br>
*If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
