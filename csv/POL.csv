Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Public spaces and services:  The Polish government has strict sanitary rules and restrictions in place nationwide. Until at least 18 April tighter restrictions will be in place. The Polish Government advice is to stay at home where possible. 
Facemasks are compulsory in open public spaces across Poland, apart from parks, forests and National Parks. Children under 4 are not required to wear facemasks. If there are medical reasons why you cannot wear a facemask, you must carry a doctor’s note with you explaining this. Bandanas, scarves, balaclavas and visors are not permitted alternatives to facemasks. Your mouth and nose must be covered. When outside, you should keep a 1.5 metre distance from others, unless you are a parent with a child under 13 or the carer of a disabled person. <br>
You must also wear a facemask at all times in enclosed spaces, on public transport, in taxis or in an open space where you are unable to maintain a 1.5 metre distance. You do not need to wear a facemask in a private car. Police and sanitary inspectors are entitled to issue you with an on-the-spot fine (approximately PLN500) if you are found not to be wearing a facemask when you should. Further prosecution could result in a fine of up to PLN 30,000 for failing to follow sanitary rules.  Seniors, aged 70 and over have been requested to stay at home, leaving only for work or necessities. <br>
Public gatherings are limited to 5 people, excluding households bigger than 5 members and workplaces. Private gatherings may include no more than 5 people, excluding household members. There are restrictions on the number of people attending religious services and funerals, with churches only permitted one person per 15m². There is a nationwide ban on wedding receptions and wakes. <br>
Public transport is operating with 50% capacity seating to maintain appropriate distance between passengers. You can still use taxis. Facemasks must be worn at all times. <br>
Cultural institutions such as museums, art galleries, theatres, opera houses, casinos and cinemas are all closed. Libraries may open with strict sanitary procedures in place. National Forests, parks and beaches are open. <br>
Non-essential shops in shopping malls and retail parks are closed (supermarkets and pharmacies remain open). Large DIY, homeware and furniture shops will also be closed from 27 March. Customer numbers are limited in shops. This might mean you have to queue for entry. In all areas of Poland a facemask must be worn inside shops and hand sanitiser must be used where provided. <br>
Petrol stations, car washes and car/motorbike repair centres remain open. Banks, insurance providers and post offices also remain open. <br>
Restaurants, cafes and pubs are closed, and can only provide a takeaway/delivery service. Sporting events are not permitted with audiences and from 27 March sports facilities are reserved for professionals only. Swimming pools, tennis courts and outdoor sports facilities, including ski slopes, are closed. Gyms, sanatoriums and aqua parks as well as tanning salons, hairdressers, massage salons and saunas, also remain closed. <br>
Administrative offices may open with limited numbers inside at any one time. You might find some offices are only open by appointment and you are recommended to check websites or contact the office before travelling as appointments may be limited. <br>
The above national measures may be extended further, in scope and time, at short notice. Some regions may have stricter rules in place. See <a href=""https://www.gov.pl/web/koronawirus/aktualne-zasady-i-ograniczenia"">here</a> (in Polish) for details of regions with stricter rules. <br>
*Road and air travel : You can enter and depart Poland by road over some land border crossings, though the situation could change quickly. Countries neighbouring Poland may introduce border restrictions at short notice. <br>
*Accommodation:  Hotels are closed except for business trips and to accommodate workers. If you have a reservation check directly with your accommodation provider for refund policies or to check your reason for stay is permitted. Hotel restaurants are closed, but room service is allowed where the hotel has guests.
