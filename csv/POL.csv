Internal Restrictions: <br> 
Flights are operating but this could change at short notice. Some airlines are making commercial decisions based on demand. If you were due to travel to or from Poland and have been informed your flight has been cancelled, contact your travel operator for more information. Flights are also operating between Poland and a number of countries including members of the <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea"">European Economic Area (EEA)</a> and Switzerland. <br>
*Travel by road: You can enter and depart Poland by car or coach over some land border crossings, though the situation could change quickly. Countries neighbouring Poland may introduce border restrictions at short notice. <br>
The Kuzniсa-Bruzgi road border crossing is currently closed, and more border checkpoints may close or implement restrictions at short notice. Coach services are available between London and Poland (journey times are in excess of 24 hours including Channel crossing).<br>
*Public spaces and services: The Polish government has sanitary rules and restrictions in place nationwide. Further guidance can be found on the <a href=""https://www.gov.pl/web/coronavirus"">Polish government website</a>. Further national or regional measures may be implemented at short notice. Accommodation, shops, services and administrative offices are open.<br>
Facemasks are compulsory in medical facilities and pharmacies but no longer required in other indoor and enclosed spaces. Children under 4 are not required to wear facemasks. If there are medical reasons why you cannot wear a facemask, you must carry a doctor’s note with you explaining this. Bandanas, scarves, balaclavas and visors are not permitted alternatives to facemasks. Your mouth and nose must be covered.<br>
*If you test positive for COVID-19 or develop symptoms: If you tested positive for COVID-19 or developed symptoms before 28 March 2022, you must self-isolate for 7 days. You must follow the advice of a medical professional who may instruct you to self-isolate for longer than 7 days.<br>
If you live with someone who tested positive for COVID-19 before 28 March 2022, you are required to quarantine for 7 days (the same length as their self-isolation), though if you are vaccinated you may leave quarantine with a negative PCR test result. If you test positive for COVID-19 or develop symptoms from 28 March 2022, neither you nor anyone you live with are legally required to isolate or quarantine. If you have come into contact with someone who is infected or potentially infected with COVID-19, you no longer have to quarantine.<br>
If you live with someone who must quarantine but has not tested positive, you are not required to quarantine or complete a test (unless you later develop symptoms or they later test positive).<br>
If you suspect you are infected with COVID-19 you should contact the Ministry of Health 24 hour hotline on 800 190 590 and press 6 for English language advice. A list of hospitals equipped to deal with COVID-19 patients can be found on the <a href=""https://www.gov.pl/web/coronavirus/hospitals"">Polish Government website</a>.<br>
If you are self-isolating or in quarantine you must not walk your dog or go shopping. You must not visit your doctor unless instructed to do so by them and you may leave your place of stay if you are required to travel to a COVID-19 testing centre.
