Internal Restrictions: <br> 
*Public spaces and services: The Polish government has strict sanitary rules and restrictions in place nationwide. <br>
Facemasks are compulsory in enclosed spaces, on public transport, in taxis or in an open space where you are unable to maintain a 1.5 metre distance. You do not need to wear a facemask in a private car. Children under 4 are not required to wear facemasks. If there are medical reasons why you cannot wear a facemask, you must carry a doctor’s note with you explaining this. Bandanas, scarves, balaclavas and visors are not permitted alternatives to facemasks. Your mouth and nose must be covered. When outside, you should keep a 1.5 metre distance from others, unless you are a parent with a child under 13 or the carer of a disabled person. <br>
Police and sanitary inspectors are entitled to issue you with an on-the-spot fine (approximately PLN500/£100) if you are found not to be wearing a facemask when you should. Further prosecution could result in a fine of up to PLN 30,000 (£6,000) for failing to follow sanitary rules. <br>
Indoor and outdoor gatherings, celebrations and events are allowed for up to 150 people. There are restrictions on the number of people attending religious services and funerals and you should contact religious venues for more information. <br>
Public transport is operating at full capacity. Facemasks must be worn at all times. <br>
Cultural institutions such as museums, art galleries, cultural centres, libraries, theatres, cinemas and operas are open. Masks must be worn when indoors with limits on capacity. <br>
National Forests, parks and beaches are open. <br>
All shops and services are open. Customer numbers are limited in shops. This might mean you have to queue for entry at busy times. In all areas of Poland a facemask must be worn inside shops and hand sanitiser must be used where provided. <br>
Restaurants, cafes and pubs are operating indoor and outdoor service with limited capacity. Night clubs and discos are open for a maximum 150 people. <br>
Open air sport facilities and grounds are open with limited capacity. <br>
Gyms, fitness clubs, hairdressers, beauty salons and saunas are open with strict hygiene rules and limits on numbers. <br>
Administrative offices may open with limited numbers inside at any one time. You might find some offices are only open by appointment and you are recommended to check websites or contact the office before travelling as appointments may be limited. <br>
National or regional measures may be implemented at short notice. <br>
*Road and air travel: You can enter and depart Poland by car or coach over some land border crossings, though the situation could change quickly. Countries neighbouring Poland may introduce border restrictions at short notice. Check country specific for any country that you plan to transit during your journey. <br>
Coach services are available between London and Poland (journey times are in excess of 24 hours including channel crossing). <br>
Flights between the UK and Poland are operating. Routes, carriers and availability vary and are based on demand. <br>
*Accommodation: Hotels are currently open with number limits.
