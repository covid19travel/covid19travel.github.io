Internal Restrictions: <br> 
*Public spaces and services: The Polish government has strict sanitary rules and restrictions in place nationwide. <br>
Facemasks are compulsory in enclosed spaces, on public transport, in taxis or in an open space where you are unable to maintain a 1.5 metre distance. You do not need to wear a facemask in a private car. Children under 4 are not required to wear facemasks. If there are medical reasons why you cannot wear a facemask, you must carry a doctor’s note with you explaining this. Bandanas, scarves, balaclavas and visors are not permitted alternatives to facemasks. Your mouth and nose must be covered. When outside, you should keep a 1.5 metre distance from others, unless you are a parent with a child under 13 or the carer of a disabled person.<br>
Police and sanitary inspectors are entitled to issue you with an on-the-spot fine (approximately PLN500) if you are found not to be wearing a facemask when you should. Further prosecution could result in a fine of up to PLN 30,000 for failing to follow sanitary rules.<br>
Gatherings, celebrations and events are allowed for up to 100 people. Sports events have a limit of maximum 250 people. Religious services and funerals have a limit of 50% capacity. These limits only apply to people who are not fully vaccinated - there are no limits for people who are fully vaccinated. <br>
Fairs, exhibitions, conferences and trade events are required to have a maximum of one person per 15 square metres. <br>
Public transport is operating at full capacity. Facemasks must be worn at all times. <br>
Cultural and leisure institutions such as museums, art galleries, cultural centres, libraries, theatres, cinemas and operas, swimming pools and aqua parks are open but operating at 50% capacity for people not fully vaccinated - there are no limits for people who are fully vaccinated. Masks must be worn when indoors.<br>
National Forests, parks and beaches are open.<br>
All shops and services are open. Customer numbers are limited in shops. This might mean you have to queue for entry at busy times. In all areas of Poland a facemask must be worn inside shops and hand sanitiser must be used where provided.<br>
Restaurants, cafes and pubs are operating with 50% capacity for people not fully vaccinated - there are no limits for people who are fully vaccinated. Nightclubs and discos are open for a maximum of 100 people. <br>

Administrative offices may open with limited numbers inside at any one time. You might find some offices are only open by appointment and you are recommended to check websites or contact the office before travelling as appointments may be limited.<br>
National or regional measures may be implemented at short notice.<br>
