International Restrictions:<br>
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19): Full details of entry requirements can be found on the  <a href="""">website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation</a>, although this has not yet been updated to reflect the latest changes to the quarantine restrictions detailed below.<br>
*Entry to Cambodia: If you wish to enter Cambodia you will need to: <br>
•  get a visa before arrival — the visa exemption policy, visa on arrival and e-visa arrangements are suspended indefinitely<br>
•  get a medical certificate, no longer than 72 hours prior to the date of travel, from a competent health authority stating you do not have COVID-19. This certificate should bear the stamp of the facility issuing it and be signed by a qualified medical practitioner to certify the test result. You should arrange to take a private test<br>
•  have proof of insurance that includes a minimum of US$50,000 for medical cover<br>
*Transiting Cambodia: It is currently not possible to enter or depart Cambodia through land borders as the Cambodia-Laos, Cambodia-Thailand and Cambodia-Vietnam land borders are closed. <br>
*Testing/screening on arrival: All foreigners arriving in Cambodia will now be subject to a COVID-19 test on arrival (as well as requiring a COVID negative test before flying). You will need to remain at a hotel or government facility until the results are known, which may include an overnight stay. <br>
The government is now imposing charges on foreign arrivals for lab testing, medical treatment and accommodation under health measures to prevent a second wave of COVID-19 transmission in Cambodia. <br>
All foreign passengers need to deposit US$2000 for the COVID-19 service charges at the airport upon their arrival. Once deductions for services have been made, the remainder of the deposit will be returned. This can be paid either by cash or credit card. <br>
The service fees are listed as below: <br>
1. US$5 for transport from the airport to waiting centre, US$100 for one COVID-19 test, US$30 for overnight stay at hotel or waiting centre and US$30 for 3 meals a day while waiting for test result.<br>
2. If one passenger tests positive for COVID-19, all those on the same flight will be quarantined for 14 days. Each passenger will have to pay US$100 for a COVID-19 test and US$84 a day to pay for the stay in a hotel or quarantine facility, (the charge includes meals, laundry, sanitary services, doctors and security services).<br>
3. For a COVID-19 positive patient, they will be charged US$100 per COVID-19 test (maximum four tests), and US$225 a day for hospital room, medical treatment service, meals, laundry and sanitary services. In addition, in case of death the cremation service charge is US$1,500.<br>
4. If issuance of a COVID-19 health certificate is needed, for example for future travel, foreign nationals will need to pay US$100 for a lab test and US$30 for the certificate.<br>
*Quarantine requirements: From 12 December 2020, the implementation of the sponsorship scheme for foreign travellers will be temporarily suspended. All travellers to Cambodia will be tested on arrival and then required to quarantine for 14 days at a facility designated by the Cambodian government. This may be at a hotel (at your own expense) or at a government facility. The conditions at government facilities are very basic and it is not guaranteed that families will be kept together. <br>
You will be expected to comply with these requirements regardless of any existing medical needs you may have. If you’re not able to submit to these requirements, you should think carefully about whether to travel to Cambodia at this time. <br>
All travellers are required to take a COVID-19 test on the 13th day of quarantine at either the Khmer-Soviet Friendship Hospital in Phnom Penh or the Chak Angre Clinic in Phnom Penh. <br>
Anyone testing positive for COVID-19 will be admitted to the Khmer-Soviet Friendship Hospital for monitoring and treatment. Their identity will also be publicly disclosed to facilitate track and trace mechanisms. <br>

 Internal Restrictions: 
*Travel in Cambodia: There has been a community outbreak of COVID-19 since 20 February 2021. The Government of Cambodia has introduced a lockdown of Phnom Penh and Takhmao (in Kandal Province) from midnight on 14 April 2021 for two weeks. On the 26 April this was extended until 5 May. Guidance is available on <a href=""https://www.mfaic.gov.kh/detail/51724"">The Cambodian Ministry of Foreign Affairs website</a>.<br>
All restaurants in Phnom Penh are closed to sit-in customers but food delivery services may be available. The sale of alcohol has also been suspended until 8 May. 
<br>
Travel between provinces is allowed from 25 April excluding travel in or out of Phnom Penh, Takhmao and other designated ‘red zones’ including parts of Sihanoukville and Poipet. Tourist sites outside the lockdown areas and red zones have also been re-opened.

Those residing inside of ‘Red Zones’ are requested to follow instructions provided by their local authority.
You’re expected to wear a face covering when inside the airport and many airlines will ask for face coverings to be worn. While no penalties are currently being imposed by the Cambodian authorities for refusing to wear a face covering, our advice is to wear a face covering when requested to. 
<br>
*Accommodation: Hotel and private rental accommodation is available throughout Cambodia. Some hotels have closed and remain so, and we advise that you contact hotels directly when booking. The majority of hotels will ask to take your temperature on arrival and ask you to complete a declaration in relation to your recent travel history and whether you have any symptoms related to COVID-19. Some services and facilities in hotels may not be available e.g. leisure facilities.<br>
*Public places and services: Many public places and services such as gyms, casinos, karaoke rooms and nightclubs have been mandated to close or have closed due to a lack of custom. You should contact venues ahead of events. On 11 March the Government of Cambodia brought in a law on <a href=""https://www.akp.gov.kh/post/detail/228560"">“Preventive Measures Against the Spread of COVID-19 and Other Severe and Dangerous Contagious Diseases”</a>. The Government has also launched a map with venues to avoid. We strongly recommend that you wear masks, clean your hands and maintain social distancing in all public places.<br>
