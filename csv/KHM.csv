*If you’re not fully vaccinated: Unvaccinated travellers are no longer required to quarantine on arrival, but must return a negative COVID-19 antigen rapid test (LFT) which will be administered by health officials at all entry points into Cambodia. There will be a charge of US$5.00 for each test administered. Travellers with a negative test result will be allowed to continue their travel in Cambodia.<br>
In the event of a positive test result, those with mild symptoms may isolate at home or at any other accommodation as determined by the Ministry of Health. Those with more severe symptoms must isolate at a designated state COVID-19 treatment centre. All costs associated with any treatment and accommodation will be borne by the traveller. You may be asked to demonstrate that you hold sufficient funds to cover all costs.<br>

If you are transiting through Cambodia on your way to another country and will be passing through immigration (sometimes known as a layover), for example to stay in a hotel for a flight the next day, you need to meet the entry requirements applicable to your vaccination status. <br>
