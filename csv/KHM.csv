You will need to remain at a hotel or government facility until the results are known, which may include an overnight stay. <br>
The government is now imposing charges on foreign arrivals for lab testing, medical treatment and accommodation under health measures to prevent a second wave of COVID-19 transmission in Cambodia. <br>
All foreign passengers need to deposit US$2000 for the COVID-19 service charges at the airport upon their arrival. Once deductions for services have been made, the remainder of the deposit will be returned. This can be paid either by cash or credit card. <br>
The service fees are listed as below: <br>

A three tier ‘zoning’ system has been introduced in major cities with ‘Red’, ‘Dark Yellow’ and ‘Yellow’ zones. The zones are in place until 12 May but subject to extension. Those residing inside ‘Red’ zones are unable to leave their zone and are requested to follow instructions provided by their local authority. Those in ‘Dark Yellow’ zones are only permitted to travel to their workplace with a letter from their employers or local authority. A curfew between 8pm and 3am remains in place in all zones and gathering with more than 10 people remains prohibited. <br>
