International Restrictions:<br>
*All travellers: You will need a visa to enter or travel through Cambodia as a visitor. Tourist visas can be applied for <a href=""https://www.evisa.gov.kh/"">online</a> or obtained on arrival. <br>
You no longer need to show a pre-arrival COVID-19 test, full COVID-19 vaccination card or certificate, or a passenger’s health declaration on arrival in Cambodia. This applies at all land, sea or air entry points. Remote temperature checkers will still be in use at entry and exit gates. <br>
*If you’re fully vaccinated: Entry requirements for Cambodia are the same for all travellers, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status. <br>
*If you’re not fully vaccinated: Entry requirements for Cambodia are the same for all travellers, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status. <br>
*Children and young people: There are no specific requirements for children and young people. <br>
*If you’re transiting through Cambodia: Transiting through Cambodia and staying in the airport (airside) is not currently permitted. <br>
If you are transiting through Cambodia on your way to another country and will be passing through immigration (sometimes known as a layover), for example to stay in a hotel for a flight the next day, you need to meet the entry requirements applicable to your vaccination status. <br>
