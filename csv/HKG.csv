After collecting baggage, travellers will be taken by shuttle bus to the designated location. Travellers will have to wait for test results, before proceeding to their mandatory quarantine hotel.
 Travellers will be required to remain at the airport, or a specified hotel overnight, whilst awaiting test results. Passengers arriving on morning flights must proceed to the Temporary Specimen Collection Centre located in the Midfield Concourse (MFC) in the restricted area of Hong Kong International Airport. You will receive test results on the same day. This could take 8 or more hours. Passengers arriving in the afternoon and evening will need to wait for test results overnight, and will be temporarily accommodated in the Department of Health Holding Centre for Test Results (HCTR) set up in the Rambler Hotel in Tsing Yi. Please note that children under the age of 16 cannot stay at the Rambler Hotel unaccompanied. Parents who stay with their child at the HCTR on the first night whilst awaiting test results, will have to continue to self-isolate for the full 14 days. If travelling unaccompanied, there is a risk that a child may have to stay alone overnight at the airport on arrival while awaiting test results. Further information is available on the <a href=""https://www.chp.gov.hk/files/pdf/holding_centre_en.pdf"">Centre for Health Protection’s website</a>. <br>
 Children over the age of 16 travelling to Hong Kong on their own must be met by an adult for checking in to the HCTR whilst they await test results. Please contact the Port Health Authority for the latest guidance (+852 3904 9333). <br>
 If the sample tests positive, the Hong Kong authorities will notify the individual and arrange for admission to a public hospital where they will remain in isolation until they test negative twice. If you are deemed to be a close contact of a positive case, you will be place in a Hong Kong government quarantine centre for 21 days. All arrivals including those who test negative for coronavirus need to undergo 21-day compulsory quarantine in a designated hotel. See “Quarantine requirements” below. <br>
 *Quarantine requirements: Quarantine is mostly spent at a <a href=""https://www.coronavirus.gov.hk/pdf/designated-hotel-list_en.pdf"">designated hotel</a> . Family members of someone who tests positive, or those who have been in close contact, will be placed in a government quarantine centre. Children travelling alone will also need to quarantine for 21 days on arrival in a designated hotel. It is down to hotel policy whether a child can self-isolate alone. Further details can be found on the Hong Kong SAR government’s website and you should call the Port Heath Division (+852 3904 9333) to understand the latest requirements if your child is travelling alone. <br>
