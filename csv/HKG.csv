For non-Hong Kong residents, there are different vaccination and testing requirements depending on the age group. For non-Hong Kong residents: <br>
12-17 years old travellers need to show proof of <a href="""">vaccination</a> to enter Hong Kong. If they have received a BioNTech vaccination, a single dose will be accepted.

They will be required to show proof of the relevant medical reason certified by a medical practitioner before boarding a flight to Hong Kong.
Children aged 3-11 are permitted to enter Hong Kong, even if they are not vaccinated. However, they are subject to all the same testing requirements as other travellers.
Children under the age of 3 are permitted to enter Hong Kong unvaccinated and are exempt from the testing requirements. <br>
People of any age who test positive for COVID-19, including children, may be isolated in government facilities for a minimum of 5 days. The decision on whether to send an individual to an isolation facility is based on their health condition, living arrangements and other risk factors. Non-residents may be charged for their care.<br>
You may be separated from your child if one of you tests positive for coronavirus. If a child has serious symptoms and is hospitalised in an ICU or paediatric ward, parents may not be allowed to see or visit their child for the duration. If this happens to you, you can call +(852) 2901 3000 for 24/7 urgent consular assistance. <br>
*If you’re transiting through Hong Kong: Transit services at Hong Kong International Airport resumed on 1 April. Transiting through Hong Kong from, but not to, mainland China is now allowed. <br>

Transit passengers travelling through Hong Kong International Airport will no longer be required to provide evidence of a pre-departure PCR test before boarding their flight to Hong Kong. If in doubt, you should check with your travel agent or airline before travelling and check the <a href=""https://www.hongkongairport.com/"">Hong Kong International Airport website</a>.
There is a risk when transiting that you will be placed into isolation in hospital in Hong Kong. All passengers transiting Hong Kong Inter-national Airport will be subject to advanced screening measures, including temperature checks. Passengers deemed to have a high temperature will undergo further checks by the Port Health Office at the airport. If you meet further risk criteria, you will be transferred to a Hong Kong public hospital for mandatory checks/treatment, where it is highly likely you will be asked to complete a mandatory COVID-19 test. If you successfully pass health screening you need to sit in designated areas at boarding gates and use designated queues in dining facilities and shops, in line with Hong Kong International Airport anti-virus measures. <br>
