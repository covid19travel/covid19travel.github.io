 International Restrictions:<br> 
*All travellers: Although Hong Kong is now part of the People’s Republic of China, it remains a Special Administrative Region (SAR) with its own immigration controls. You can visit Hong Kong for up to 6 months without a visa. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, different entry requirements are being applied in Hong Kong. For up-to-date advice on entry requirements and restrictions, please visit the <a href=""https://www.coronavirus.gov.hk/eng/inbound-travel.html"">Hong Kong SAR Government’s website</a>.
Hong Kong residents and vaccinated non-Hong Kong residents who have visited the UK are permitted to enter Hong Kong. <br>
From 26 September, inbound travellers are no longer required to undergo quarantine at a designated quarantine hotel. <br>
Inbound travellers who have visited the overseas destinations within the past 7 days are required to undergo 3 days of medical surveillance at home or other self-arranged accommodation. For these 3 days, arrivals can leave their residences but will be restricted from certain premises under the Vaccine Pass scheme, including restaurants and bars. Multiple PCR tests and daily rapid antigen tests are required until day 7 following arrival. <br>
Travellers departing for Hong Kong will need to provide a negative rapid antigen test result for COVID-19, taken no more than 24 hours prior to their departure. They will need to submit in advance an online <a href=""https://www.chp.gov.hk/hdf/"">Health & Quarantine Information Declaration</a> confirming their rapid test result and vaccination record where relevant and present a declaration QR code generated during check-in. <br>

*Testing on arrival: All travellers ending their journey at Hong Kong International Airport will have to undergo a PCR test for coronavirus but do not need to remain at the airport awaiting their test results.

If you test negative, you will be issued an amber QR code in the LeaveHomeSafe contact tracing app if you possess a smart mobile phone. For 3 days, you can leave your residence but you will be restricted from certain premises under the Vaccine Pass scheme, including restaurants and bars. <br>
If you test positive, you will be required to self-isolate for a minimum of 7 days. You may be able to stay at your original accommodation or hotel. If your hotel does not allow on-site isolation then you will be required to move to a designated isolation hotel. The Hong Kong authorities may also arrange for admission to a public hospital or a government isolation facility. Travellers may be expected to cover the cost of self-isolation. The decision on whether to send an individual to these facilities is based on their health condition, living arrangements and other risk factors. <br>
If you are deemed to be a contact of a positive case, you may be placed in a Hong Kong Government quarantine centre or hotel for a minimum of 7 days if your current living environment is unsuitable. <br>
Proof of vaccination status: From 1 April, fully vaccinated travellers who have visited other overseas destinations are permitted to enter Hong Kong. <br>
For travellers arriving from other countries, Hong Kong will accept the proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your last vaccine dose must have been administered at least 14 days prior to travel. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. Children under the age of 12 who are not vaccinated will be allowed to enter with a fully vaccinated accompanying adult. <br>
Travel between Hong Kong, Macao and mainland China
All border crossings with mainland China remain closed indefinitely, with the exception of the Shenzhen Bay Checkpoint and the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge. All passengers wanting to board a shuttle bus to cross the bridge departing from Hong Kong to Macao must present a certificate confirming that they have tested negative for COVID-19 within 24 hours of their departure. The special ferry service between Taipa Ferry Terminal in Macao and Hong Kong International Airport has now ceased operations. All ferry crossings between Hong Kong and mainland China are currently not in operation with the exception of the service from Shenzhen Shekou Port to Hong Kong International Airport. Kai Tak Cruise and Ocean Terminals are also closed to passengers indefinitely. <br>
Hong Kong residents in mainland China are eligible for the Return2hk scheme, which enables quarantine free travel from mainland China to Hong Kong. Non-residents in mainland China and Macao are eligible for the Come2hk scheme, which offers similar exemptions to entry requirements. You can find further information on the <a href=""https://www.coronavirus.gov.hk/eng/return2hk-scheme.html"">Hong Kong SAR government coronavirus website</a>.
*If you’re not fully vaccinated: From 26 September, Hong Kong residents who are not fully vaccinated will be able to enter Hong Kong. Non-residents who are not fully vaccinated and have visited places outside mainland China, Macao or Taiwan within the past 7 days, will be denied entry into Hong Kong. <br>
If you are unable to be fully vaccinated due to medical reasons, you may still be permitted entry to Hong Kong. You will be required to show proof of the relevant medical reason certified by a medical practitioner before boarding a flight to Hong Kong. Children under the age of 12 who are not vaccinated will be allowed to enter with a vaccinated accompanying adult. <br>
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year: If you have previously infected with COVID-19 and have received one dose of COVID-19 vaccine, you will be considered fully vaccinated. <br>
If you have tested positive for COVID-19 recently, you may still enter Hong Kong if you can provide evidence of a negative rapid antigen test taken within 24 hours of your scheduled departure time. <br>
Should you test positive on the PCR test required on arrival in Hong Kong, the Department for Health will take recovery certificates into account when deciding on the location and duration of the quarantine order you are issued. <br>
As with all cases of a positive test on arrival in Hong Kong, there is a risk that you will be placed in a hospital for a minimum of 7 days. <br>
*Children and young people: Proof of a single dose of the BioNTech vaccination will be accepted for 12-17 year-old travellers entering Hong Kong. <br>
Unvaccinated minors under the age of 12 will also be permitted entry to Hong Kong if they are travelling with fully vaccinated adults who meet the requirements. They will be subject to the same quarantine and testing requirements as the adults accompanying them. <br>
Children 12-17 years of age who meet the vaccination requirements and are travelling alone will also need to quarantine for 3 days on arrival in a designated hotel. It is down to hotel policy whether a child can self-isolate alone. Further details can be found on the Hong Kong SAR government’s website and you should call the Port Heath Division (+852 3904 9333) to understand the latest requirements if your child is travelling alone. <br>
From 1 June, children under the age of 3 will no longer be required to present proof of a pre-departure test when entering Hong Kong. They will still be subject to both PCR and rapid antigen testing on arrival. <br>
*If you’re transiting through Hong Kong: Transit services at Hong Kong International Airport resumed on 1 April. Transiting through Hong Kong from, but not to, mainland China is now allowed. <br>
Transit passengers travelling through Hong Kong International Airport must have an onward flight booked, which departs within 24 hours of their scheduled time of arrival in Hong Kong. <br>
Transit passengers travelling through Hong Kong International Airport will no longer be required to provide evidence of a pre-departure PCR test before boarding their flight to Hong Kong. If in doubt, you should check with your travel agent or airline before travelling and check the <a href=""https://www.hongkongairport.com/"">Hong Kong International Airport website</a>.
There is a risk when transiting that you will be placed into isolation in hospital in Hong Kong. All passengers transiting Hong Kong Inter-national Airport will be subject to advanced screening measures, including temperature checks. Passengers deemed to have a high temperature will undergo further checks by the Port Health Office at the airport. If you meet further risk criteria, you will be transferred to a Hong Kong public hospital for mandatory checks/treatment, where it is highly likely you will be asked to complete a mandatory COVID-19 test. If you successfully pass health screening you need to sit in designated areas at boarding gates and use designated queues in dining facilities and shops, in line with Hong Kong International Airport anti-virus measures. <br>
