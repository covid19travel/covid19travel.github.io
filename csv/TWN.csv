Test Certificates of a negative COVID-19 RT-PCR must be issued by a recognised medical institution in the country of departure and include the following information:<br>
•        the passenger’s full name as per their passport,<br>
•        the date of birth or passport number of the traveller,<br>
•        specimen collection date and test report date,<br>

Test Certificates are required to be produced in either English or Chinese; however, in situations where the passenger provides a certificate in either French or Spanish, if the certificate is in the official language of the place of departure, and ground personnel of the airline are able to assist with the inspection of the content, the certificate may be accepted.<br>
All passengers arriving in Taiwan will be required to undergo a COVID-19 PCR test using a saliva sample upon arrival before being permitted to proceed to their pre-arranged quarantine facility.

Passengers who test positive and are quarantining at a designated quarantine hotel will be notified and transferred to an enhanced epidemic prevention hotel, designated quarantine centre or hospital for further treatment. The decision regarding these arrangements will be made by the <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov.tw/En"">Taiwan Centers for Disease Control</a> and will depend on the severity of your symptoms.<br>
