Passengers who test positive and are quarantining at a designated quarantine hotel will be notified and transferred to an enhanced epidemic prevention hotel, designated quarantine centre or hospital for further treatment. The decision regarding these arrangements will be made by the 
<a href=""https://www.cdc.gov.tw/En"">Taiwan Centers for Disease Control  </a> and will depend on the severity of your symptoms. <br>
From 15 June 2022, all passengers arriving in Taiwan from overseas will now be able to choose between taking a quarantine taxi or having a friend or relative pick them up from the airport and take them to their pre-arranged quarantine accommodation. <br>
Anyone found to provide false or incorrect test results, or evade or obstruct the quarantine measures, may face a fine of between NT$10,000 to NT$150,000 and further criminal charges. <br>
