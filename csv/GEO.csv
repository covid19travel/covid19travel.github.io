(1) Unrestricted entry for citizens of any country, including the UK, who have documentary proof of having received a full course of COVID vaccination. <br>
(2) Other UK citizens can enter Georgia provided your travel to Georgia originates in the UK or one of the other countries listed on the <a href=""https://mfa.gov.ge/MainNav/CoVID-19-sakitkhebi/sazgvris-kvetis-regulaciebi.aspx"">Ministry of Foreign Affairs website</a>.

(3) Of particular relevance to UK citizens - following discovery of a new strain of coronavirus in the UK, the Georgian Government announced that anyone entering Georgia who has been in the UK within the previous 14 days must undergo mandatory 12-day quarantine. This requirement applies to all nationalities and all entry or visa routes. Full details are on the <a href=""https://mfa.gov.ge/MainNav/CoVID-19-sakitkhebi/sazgvris-kvetis-regulaciebi.aspx?lang=en-US"">Ministry of Foreign Affairs website</a>. <br>
*Entry permits and extensions: For foreign citizens who were legally in Georgia before 14 March 2020, the Georgian Government has extended the period that their entry permits remain valid until 1 July 2021, provided the overstay was caused by one of the following circumstances, which must be documented: <br>
•        if the person’s home country was a COVID high risk zone<br>
•        if there were border restrictions in the person’s home country<br>
•        if the person was in hospital or self-isolating for health reasons<br>
•        if the person could not leave Georgia due to cancelled flights. <br>
If you were legally in Georgia by 14 March and wish to renew your stay without applying for a residence card, you will need to <a href=""https://www.my.gov.ge/"">book an appointment at Public Service Hall</a> 
. <br>
You should attend your appointment with a Georgian-speaker as you will need to make your renewal application and be interviewed in Georgian. Your application must include the reason why you could not renew your visa in time. The fee is 50 lari. Public Service Hall will review the case and make a decision within three days on whether, and if so, for how long to renew your visa. <br>
If during your visit to Georgia up to March 2020 you were driving using your UK driving license, and you have not been able to leave Georgia since due to Covid restrictions, you can continue to drive using the UK licence (provided it remains valid) for the remainder of your current visit to Georgia. <br>
If you are working or studying in Georgia and meet the requirements for a Georgian Residence Permit, you should apply for this through Public Service Hall. You should not remain on a visitor’s entry permit indefinitely. <br>
If you are in Georgia for more than 183 days and take up any form of paid employment, you are automatically liable for income tax and must inform the Revenue Service of your employment, whether you are on a visitor’s permit or officially resident. Non-compliance will be fined. <br>
