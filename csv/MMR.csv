  International Restrictions: <br>
 *Entry to Myanmar: The government of Myanmar has suspended all international commercial passenger flights from any of its airports until 28 February 2021 at the earliest. It will then review the situation. Residents of the UK, or those who have visited the UK within the previous 14 days, are currently unable to enter Myanmar. Those not travelling from the United Kingdom, including British Nationals, should check the requirements for travel from that country to Myanmar with the relevant Myanmar Embassy or Consulate. If you are on a flight transiting via the UK, you will only be allowed to enter Myanmar if your transit time was for six hours or fewer. This is subject to short notice changes. Prior to travel you should check with the nearest Myanmar Embassy. New tourist visa applications are currently suspended. At present Myanmar authorities can offer business visas to foreign nationals with a compelling case. You or your employer must make your case to your nearest Myanmar Embassy and obtain permission. These arrangements are subject to change and at short notice. <br>
 *Testing/Screening on arrival: There are temperature checks for all arrivals. Arrivals must provide evidence of a negative COVID-19 test result. Testing requirements ahead of entry to Myanmar are subject to change. Confirmation should be sought from the relevant Myanmar Embassy or Consulate well in advance of your departure. <br>
 *Quarantine requirements: Arrivals in Myanmar must enter government-arranged quarantine. You will be allotted your quarantine facility on arrival. You may have no choice but will be placed in the same government quarantine facility or hotel as all the other people on your flight. You will be provided with food, for which you will be charged. The exact length of your quarantine will depend on your travel history. You should confirm your quarantine requirements with the relevant Myanmar Embassy or Consulate before you travel. Those arriving in Myanmar may need to abide by the following quarantine requirements: 
 • complete 7 days home quarantine prior to the date of travel. This must be verified by an employer’s or doctor’s declaration, or a self-declaration. During these 7 days you may only leave your place of quarantine to take a COVID test;
 • provide evidence of a negative COVID test result;
 • complete 7 days quarantine in a government facility or government approved hotel on arrival in Myanmar (allocated on arrival);
 • undertake a COVID test after 7 days (through the National Health Laboratory, at a cost is MMK 200,000). If you test negative, you must complete a further 7 days of home quarantine, and will then be able to leave quarantine. If you test positive, you will be transferred to a designated government hospital for COVID patients. You will need to remain for 28 days in hospital, after which you can leave if you have tested negative for COVID for two consecutive weeks prior.
 These rules are subject to change at short notice, and the government of Myanmar can extend quarantine periods for a number of reasons, even for those who have been granted permission to undergo a shorter quarantine period. This includes if any person on a flight you might have used tests positive for COVID-19, or in response to the situation in a country you might have recently visited. You may be required to do more than one COVID-19 test before you leave quarantine, even if you test negative.
 If hospitalised with coronavirus, patients are obliged to use a government facility even if they have private insurance. Patients in government hospitals are generally expected to make their own arrangements for bringing in food and other essential supplies. Lone travellers will not be allowed out of isolation to buy food or make phone calls. These arrangements are subject to change and at short notice. Confirmation should be sought from the relevant Myanmar Embassy or Consulate well in advance of your departure. <br>
 *Data collection: Arrivals will be expected to provide contact details. We are not aware of any requirement to download an app.

Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Travel in Myanmar: A limited schedule of domestic flights is operating, though the rules for access to these is not clear. You are advised to stay home at night, and minimise movement during the day, avoiding crowds. If you do still attempt to travel domestically, please note that you may encounter checkpoints on your journey. Prior to recent events, those taking a domestic flight inside Myanmar needed to take a COVID-19 test no more than 36 hours prior to departure. You may still be required to quarantine on arrival at your destination, particularly if you are coming from an area under a ‘Stay at Home’ order. You should contact individual airlines for details, and should comply with all the relevant guidance and regulations while travelling.<br>
In some areas there may be local requirements for visitors from other parts of the country, including the requirement to take a COVID-19 test in advance of travel, and to quarantine on arrival. You should check with local authorities for information on possible local preventative measures. The majority of townships in Yangon are currently under a ‘Stay at Home’ order. Coco Island Region, Seikkyi/Khanaungto, Twantay, and Kwangyangon are not under a ‘Stay at Home’ order. The rules for Yangon townships under a ‘Stay at Home’ order state that residents should stay in their own homes. Only one person per household is allowed to go out for essential supplies, or two people can leave the home to visit a hospital or clinic. Only the driver and one passenger can travel in a car at the same time, unless travelling to a hospital or clinic, in which case, there can be two passengers. Those who work in ‘essential private services’ are excluded from this order. Essential private services are defined by the government of Myanmar as banks, financial services, petrol stations, livestock and refrigeration industries, production and distribution of pharmaceutical products, production and distribution of drinking water and personal items. A curfew from 8pm until 4am each day is currently in effect in Yangon and other cities across Myanmar.<br>
Other parts of Myanmar are also under ‘Stay at Home’ orders. You should confirm with the local ward administrator if you are unsure whether an area is subject to a ‘Stay at Home’ order. Anyone wishing to travel to or from an area subject to a ‘Stay at Home’ order may need to contact the relevant local authorities to confirm the requirements for travel.<br>
This guidance from the government of Myanmar is subject to change, and you should check the information issued by the <a href=""https://www.mofa.gov.mm/"">Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a> on their website and on their <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/mofamyanmar/"">Facebook page</a> before you travel inside Myanmar. Further information is also available on the Facebook page for the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/MinistryOfHealthAndSportsMyanmar"">Ministry of Health and Sports</a>  and at their <a href=""https://www.mohs.gov.mm/Home"">website</a>. If you are outside of Myanmar, you should refer to your nearest Myanmar Embassy.<br>
Since 13 May 2020 it has been compulsory for anyone going out in public in Myanmar to wear a facemask. Failure to wear one will result in a fine. This requirement is being enforced strictly and has led to the arrest of some offenders. It is recommended that foreigners carry: <br>
•        passport<br>
•        Form C (immigration document) <br>
•        Foreigner’s Registration Certificate<br>
•        Myanmar Driver’s Licence (if you own a car) <br>
•        a copy of your passport information page<br>
•        a copy of your Myanmar visa<br>
•        a copy of your immigration stamp showing when you last entered Myanmar. <br>
*Accommodation: There have been reports that some local authorities are carrying out checks to make sure all foreign visitors are staying in registered hotels and guest houses, not in private apartments. This is a requirement under Myanmar law and is a condition of your visa. Some hotels have reopened but many tourist resorts remain closed.<br>
*Public places and services: Some restaurants, bars and shops have reopened with temperature checks and social distancing measures in place. Some shopping centres may need customers to register their details upon entry. You must wear a face mask in all public places, and a face shield might be required in some locations.The government of Myanmar ordered all schools, including private ones, to close from 26 August. The date for re-opening has not yet been announced.
