International Restrictions: <br>
*All travellers: You will need the following to enter Bangladesh: <br>
•        a visa (see below for information on visas). <br>
*If you’re fully vaccinated: If you’re fully vaccinated you can enter Bangladesh without needing to quarantine, provided your vaccination course was completed no less than 14 days prior to arrival. A pre-departure negative RT-PCR test result for COVID-19 is no longer required in such circumstances. <br>
Proof of vaccination status: Bangladesh will accept the proof of COVID-19 vaccination record. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered at least 14 days prior to travel. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
*If you’re not fully vaccinated: Arriving passengers who are unable to provide proof of vaccination, or proof that their vaccination course was completed at least 14 days prior to arrival, are required to present evidence of a negative RT PCR based COVID-19 test taken no more than 72 hours prior to departure for Bangladesh. You should arrange to take a private test. <br>
All passengers, regardless of vaccination status, may be subjected to additional health screening measures on arrival. Passengers with COVID-19 symptoms will be required to take a PCR test. Those testing positive will be required to isolate at a government authorised facility for at least seven days and until they test negative in a subsequent PCR test. <br>
In all circumstances, people staying in a government approved hotel, government facility or hospital will need to cover the costs of those stays and any necessary COVID-19 tests. <br>
The Bangladesh authorities may retain passports of any passengers in quarantine and will re-turn them at the end of the quarantine period. <br>
Passengers with a No Visa Required certificate (an arrangement for foreign nationals of Bangladeshi heritage) arriving in Bangladesh without a medical certificate indicating they are COVID-19 negative, or such passengers who display symptoms, will be transferred to a government facility where their quarantine period will be assessed and determined. <br>
*Exemptions: Exemptions to quarantine arrangements are issued on an exceptional and case by case basis. Travellers should contact the Bangladesh High Commission or Bangladesh authorities in advance of travel to discuss any possible exemptions. <br>
