 If you’re fully vaccinated you can enter Bangladesh without needing to quarantine, provided your vaccination course was completed no less than 14 days prior to arrival. <br>","Latest News: 
<br> 
<br>
International Restrictions: <br>
*All travellers: You will need the following to enter Bangladesh: <br>
•        a visa (see below for information on visas). <br>
•        an online Health Declaration form The <a href=""http://healthdeclaration.dghs.gov.bd/"">form</a>
 needs to be completed within three days of arrival. You may need to present a copy of the submitted form when you check in with your airline and/or when you arrive in Bangladesh. <br>
*If you’re fully vaccinated you can enter Bangladesh without needing to quarantine, provided your vaccination course was completed no less than 14 days prior to arrival. <br>
A pre-departure negative RT-PCR test result for COVID-19 is no longer required in such circumstances. <br>
Proof of vaccination status: Bangladesh will accept the proof of COVID-19 vaccination record. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered at least 14 days prior to travel. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
*If you’re not fully vaccinated: Arrivals from who are unable to provide proof of vaccination, or proof that their vaccination course was completed at least 14 days prior to arrival, are required to present evidence of a negative RT PCR based COVID-19 test taken no more than 72 hours prior to departure for Bangladesh. You should arrange to take a private test. <br>
All passengers, regardless of vaccination status, may be subjected to additional health screening measures on arrival. Passengers with COVID-19 symptoms may be required to take a PCR test. Those testing positive will be required to isolate at a government authorised facility for at least seven days and until they test negative in a subsequent PCR test. <br>
In all circumstances, people staying in a government approved hotel, government facility or hospital will need to cover the costs of those stays and any necessary COVID-19 tests. <br>
The Bangladesh authorities may retain passports of any passengers in quarantine and will re-turn them at the end of the quarantine period. <br>
Passengers with a No Visa Required certificate (an arrangement for foreign nationals of Bangladeshi heritage) arriving in Bangladesh without a medical certificate indicating they are COVID-19 negative, or such passengers who display symptoms, will be transferred to a government facility where their quarantine period will be assessed and determined. <br>
*Exemptions: Exemptions to quarantine arrangements are issued on an exceptional and case by case basis. Travellers should contact the Bangladesh High Commission or Bangladesh authorities in advance of travel to discuss any possible exemptions. <br>
Children and young people: There is no requirement for children under 12 to present a negative RT PCR COVID-19 test result. Children under 12 should follow the same regime that applies to those family members they are travelling with, regardless of their vaccination status. <br>
If you’re transiting through Bangladesh: Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination. <br>
For those planning to transit through Bangladesh on your way to another country, visas for Bangladesh are not required for those remaining airside at the airport. However, we have been unable to confirm that COVID-19 measures do not apply, and we would recommend meeting the Government of Bangladesh’s COVID-19 requirements. For example, unvaccinated travellers may wish to ensure that they have a negative PCR test result, taken no more than 72 hours of their departure, and familiarise themselves with any airline requirements, together with those of the final destination. <br>
<br> <br> 
Internal Restrictions:<br>
On 12 January, the Bangladesh authorities announced a number of new measures in response to the Omicron coronavirus variant. This includes wearing masks in public spaces, capacity restrictions in public settings, including on public transport, a requirement to show vaccination status in some settings and the introduction of rapid antigen testing for international arrivals. <br>
*Moving around in Bangladesh: Public transport, including domestic flights, is operating. However COVID related travel restrictions may come into force at short notice and you should check local guidance and media reports for the latest developments.<br>
*Face masks must be worn at all times when moving in and around Bangladesh. Anyone not complying with these requests risks legal action.<br>
*Businesses and services: Businesses, including shops, offices and banking services, have largely resumed operations with minimal restrictions.<br>
*Accommodation: Hotels and guesthouses are operating. Check with your travel or accommodation provider for available options..
