*Testing/Screening on arrival: Travellers arriving in Australia may need to undergo enhanced health screening on arrival. This can include temperature testing. You may also be asked to undergo screening or testing in quarantine. <br>
The Australian authorities provide an <a href=""https://www.health.gov.au/resources/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-international-travellers"">‘Information for international travellers fact sheet’</a> to all travellers on arrival in Australia. This provides information on current requirements <br>
For advice and measures at individual airports, see their websites. <br>
*Transiting Australia: The <a href=""https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/transiting-australia"">Department of Home Affairs website</a> sets out information on transiting Australia, including on transit visas. There are currently restrictions on transits due to coronavirus. <br>
You’re able to transit through Australia if transiting for 72 hours or less and you have evidence of onward international travel. If you intend to spend longer than 72 hours in Australia waiting for your connecting flight, you’re not considered to be transiting, and will need to request an exemption from the Australian Border Force Commissioner. <br>
Due to COVID-19 related border restrictions, you can usually only travel to Australia to transit to another country if your connecting flight leaves from the same airport. <br>
State quarantine requirements remain in place, and airport operating hours vary. This may limit how long you can stay in the airport, and whether you need to apply for exemption from Australia’s 14-day quarantine arrangements issued by the relevant State health authority. You should check with your airline, as well as on <a href=""https://www.health.gov.au/about-us/contact-us/local-state-and-territory-health-departments"">State and Territory websites</a> for the latest details and how to apply. <br>
All airports should allow passengers to remain in the airport if your transit is less than 8 hours and on the same day. You must remain airside and you will not be able to pass customs (even to collect your baggage). You will need to maintain social distancing, cough etiquette and hand hygiene. At your first point of departure, you will need to have checked your baggage through to your final destination. <br>
If you have to leave the airport you will be taken on arrival in Australia to a designated quarantine facility by Australian authorities. You will need to remain there until proceeding to the airport for your departing flight. You may need to pay for quarantine - you should check <a href=""https://www.health.gov.au/news/health-alerts/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-health-alert/coronavirus-covid-19-advice-for-travellers"">State and Territory websites</a> for details on quarantine.
Foreign nationals are able to transit through Australia for a maximum of 8 hours without a visa. If your transit time is longer than 8 hours you will need a valid visa. See the <a href=""https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/transiting-australia"">Department of Home Affairs website</a> for details including how to apply.
If you plan to travel or transit on from Australia, check the latest entry restrictions for your destination and keep in touch with your airline, cruise line or tour operator before you travel. <br>
*Visas during COVID-19: The latest COVID-19 guidance on visa conditions and details how to apply for a visa is available on the <a href=""https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/""> Department of Home Affairs website</a>. The guidance is clear that any visa application will be assessed considering the COVID-19 enhanced border measures and the applicant’s individual circumstances. Applications for new visas should be made before a current visa expires, and if a current visa holder has a “no further stay” condition, a request to waive this condition must be made. <br>
If you’re unable to leave Australia and your visa is nearing expiry or has expired already, you should contact the Australian Department of Home Affairs as soon as possible. Australia does not issue visa extensions so you will need to apply for a new one to remain lawful in Australia, and provide relevant supporting documentation. The type of visa you can apply for to remain in Australia usually depends on the type of visa you currently hold. For example, those on Visitor visas would be expected to apply for new Visitor visas.
You can find more detail for temporary visa holders, including visitors, students and working holiday makers on the Department of Home Affairs <a href=""https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/travel-restrictions"">webpage</a>.
*Leaving Australia: You should check the  <a href=""https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/leaving-australia"">Department of Home Affairs website</a> for information on leaving Australia, including whether you need an exemption. <br>
From 1 November, fully vaccinated Australian citizens and permanent residents will not require an exemption.<br>
Dual Australian/British nationals and permanent residents who are unvaccinated (apart from those under 12 and those who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons) are required to apply for an exemption to leave Australia. Temporary visa holders do not need an exemption to leave the country, but will need an exemption if they want to re-enter. <br>
Temporary visa holders seeking to leave Australia for a short trip and then return will need to apply for an inwards exemption before they leave – see the Department of Home Affairs<a href=""https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/leaving-australia#toc-6"">‘Leaving Australia’ web pages</a> for more information.
