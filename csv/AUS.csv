  International Restrictions: <br>
 *Entry to Australia: On 8 January 2021 the Australian National Cabinet agreed to additional domestic and international aviation measures:<br>
 Returning Australians and other travellers to Australia must return a negative COVID-19 test prior to departure. Exemptions will only be applied in extenuating circumstances, such as seasonal workers where there is limited access to testing. All passengers and air crew must wear masks on flights and in airports. Further details are available <a href=""https://www.pm.gov.au/media/statement-national-cabinet"">here</a>. Only Australian citizens and returning permanent residents and their immediate family members are permitted to enter Australia without an exemption until further notice.<br>
 Travellers who meet exemption criteria or have a compassionate or compelling reason to enter Australia can <a href=""https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/help-support/departmental-forms/online-forms/covid19-enquiry-form"">apply</a> to the Australian authorities for an exemption, For information on the exemption categories, application form and documentation needed, see the Department of Home Affairs <a href=""https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/travel-restrictions-0"">website</a>. 
 The Department of Home Affairs is experiencing high levels of demand for exemptions and there is no guarantee of either the timing of a decision or the outcome. You should make your application at least four weeks but not more than three months in advance of travel and provide full supporting documentation. <br>
 *Quarantine requirements: All international travellers entering Australia need to undertake a mandatory 14-day quarantine at a designated facility (for example a hotel) at their port of arrival. This is arranged by individual State and Territory governments. States and Territories are introducing charges for quarantine. These are already in place in New South Wales, the Northern Territory, Queensland and South Australia and are likely to be introduced in other States soon. For further details on quarantine including fees, see these websites:
 <a href=""https://www.nsw.gov.au/covid-19/what-you-can-and-cant-do-under-rules/quarantine"">New South Wales</a> - if you made your flight booking before 11:59pm AEST on 12 July, you will not have to pay;
 <a href=""https://coronavirus.nt.gov.au/stay-safe/quarantine/quarantine-fee"">The Northern Territory</a> - for further details including fees; 
 <a href=""https://www.qld.gov.au/health/conditions/health-alerts/coronavirus-covid-19/protect-yourself-others/quarantine"">Queensland</a> - if you made your flight booking before midnight on 17 June 2020, you will not have to pay; 
 <a href=""https://www.wa.gov.au/government/publications/paying-hotel-quarantine-wa-frequently-asked-questions"">Western Australia</a> - you may face a range of penalties for non-compliance with quarantine measures. <br>
 *Testing/Screening on arrival: All travellers arriving in Australia may need to undergo enhanced health screening on arrival before going into quarantine. This can include temperature testing. You may also be asked to undergo screening or testing in quarantine. The Australian authorities provide an <a href=""https://www.health.gov.au/resources/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-international-travellers"">‘Information for international travellers fact sheet’</a> to all travellers on arrival in Australia. This provides information on current requirements For advice and measures at individual airports, see their websites. <br> <br>
 *Transiting Australia: The Department of Home Affairs <a href=""https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/transiting-australia"">website</a> sets out information on transiting Australia, including on transit visas. There are currently restrictions on transits due to coronavirus.
 You’re able to transit through Australia if transiting for 72 hours or less and you have evidence of onward international travel. If you intend to spend longer than 72 hours in Australia waiting for your connecting flight, you’re not considered to be transiting, and will need to request an exemption from the Australian Border Force Commissioner. Due to COVID-19 related border restrictions, you can usually only travel to Australia to transit to another country if your connecting flight leaves from the same airport. State quarantine requirements remain in place, and airport operating hours vary. This may limit how long you can stay in the airport, and whether you need to apply for exemption from Australia’s 14-day quarantine arrangements issued by the relevant State health authority. You should check with your airline, as well as on State and Territory <a href=""https://www.health.gov.au/about-us/contact-us/local-state-and-territory-health-departments"">websites</a>for the latest details and how to apply. All airports should allow passengers to remain in the airport if your transit is less than 8 hours and on the same day. You must remain airside and you will not be able to pass customs (even to collect your baggage). You will need to maintain social distancing, cough etiquette and hand hygiene. At your first point of departure, you will need to have checked your baggage through to your final destination. If you have to leave the airport you will be taken on arrival in Australia to a designated quarantine facility by Australian authorities. You will need to remain there until proceeding to the airport for your departing flight. You may need to pay for quarantine - you should check State and Territory <a href=""https://www.health.gov.au/news/health-alerts/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-health-alert/coronavirus-covid-19-advice-for-travellers"">website</a> for details on quarantine. 
 If you plan to travel or transit on from Australia, check the latest entry restrictions for your destination and keep in touch with your airline, cruise line or tour operator before you travel.<br>
 *Leaving Australia: You should check the Department of Home Affairs website for information on leaving Australia, including whether you need an exemption.
 The Australian authorities continue to advise international visitors to leave Australia where possible due to the COVID-19 situation.
 Temporary visa holders do not need an exemption to leave the country, but will need an exemption if they want to re-enter – see the Department of Home Affairs ‘Coming to Australia’ web pages for more information.
