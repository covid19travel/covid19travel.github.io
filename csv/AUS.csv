*Testing/Screening on arrival: Travellers arriving in Australia may need to undergo enhanced health screening on arrival. This can include temperature testing. You may also be asked to undergo screening or testing in quarantine. The Australian authorities provide an <a href=""https://www.health.gov.au/resources/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-international-travellers"">‘Information for international travellers fact sheet’</a> to all travellers on arrival in Australia. This provides information on current requirements. For advice and measures at individual airports, see their websites. <br>
*Transiting Australia: The <a href=""https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/transiting-australia"">Department of Home Affairs website</a> sets out information on transiting Australia, including on transit visas. There are currently restrictions on transits due to COVID-19. <br>
Foreign nationals are exempt from Australia’s travel restrictions (and do not need to request an exemption) if transiting Australia for 72 hours or less. Evidence of an onward ticket is required. <br>
Due to COVID-19 related border restrictions, you can usually only travel to Australia to transit to another country if your connecting flight departs from the same airport. <br>
State quarantine requirements remain in place, and airport operating hours vary. This may limit how long you can stay in the airport, and whether you will be subject to the quarantine requirements of the state or territory you have arrived in. <br>
If you have to leave the airport, you may be taken on arrival to a designated quarantine facility. You will need to remain there until returning to the airport for your departing flight. You may need to pay for quarantine - you should check <a href=""https://www.health.gov.au/news/health-alerts/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-health-alert/coronavirus-covid-19-advice-for-travellers"">State and Territory websites</a> for details. <br>
Foreign  nationals are able to transit through Australia for a maximum of 8 hours without a visa. You must remain airside and you will not be able to clear immigration (including to collect baggage, which should have been checked through to your final destination). If your transit time is longer than 8 hours you will need a visa. See the <a href=""https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/transiting-australia"">Department of Home Affairs website</a> for details. If you plan to transit Australia, check the latest entry restrictions for your destination and keep in touch with your airline, cruise line or tour operator before you travel. <br>
*Visas during COVID-19: The latest COVID-19 guidance on visa conditions and details on how to apply for a visa is available on the <a href=""https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/"">Department of Home Affairs website</a>. The guidance is clear that any visa application will be assessed considering the COVID-19 enhanced border measures and the applicant’s individual circumstances. Applications for new visas should be made before a current visa expires, and if a current visa holder has a “no further stay” condition, a request to waive this condition must be made. <br>
If you’re unable to leave Australia and your visa is nearing expiry or has expired already, you should contact the Australian Department of Home Affairs as soon as possible. Australia does not issue visa extensions so you will need to apply for a new visa to remain lawful in Australia, and provide relevant supporting documentation. The type of visa you can apply for to remain in Australia usually depends on the type of visa you currently hold. For example, those on Visitor visas would be expected to apply for new Visitor visas. <br>
You can find more detail for temporary visa holders, including visitors, students and working holiday makers on the Department of Home Affairs <a href=""https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/travel-restrictions"" >webpage</a>.
*Leaving Australia: You should check the <a href=""https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/leaving-australia"">Department of Home Affairs website  </a> for information on leaving Australia, including whether you need an exemption. <br>
As of 1 November, fully vaccinated Australian citizens and permanent residents no longer require an exemption to depart Australia.
If you are an Australian citizen or permanent resident, you will need to present an International COVID-19 Vaccination Certificate (ICVC). If you were vaccinated outside of Australia and do not have an ICVC, you will need to present a foreign vaccination certificate. For full details please refer to the <a href=""https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/vaccinated-travellers"">Department of Home Affairs website</a>.
Australian citizens and permanent residents who are unvaccinated (apart from those under 12 and those who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons) must apply for an exemption to depart Australia. Temporary visa holders do not need an exemption to depart Australia, but may need an exemption to re-enter. However, from December 15 fully vaccinated eligible visa holders will be able to enter Australia without obtaining an exemption, depending on visa type and vaccination status. Details can be found on the <a href=""https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/vaccinated-travellers#toc-8"">Department of Home Affairs website</a>.
