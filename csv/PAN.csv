International Restrictions: <br>
*All travellers: You will not need a visa to enter or travel through Panama as a visitor. An electronic affidavit of good health for all travellers needs to be completed before entering the country. The affidavit form is available on the <a href=""https://www.panamadigital.gob.pa/RegistroPacoViajero"">Panama digital website</a>. The completed affidavit will generate a QR code which will be scanned on arrival at Panama City Tocumen Airport. <br>
Panama encourages the use of the IATA Travel Pass app. This app will have up-to-date information on travel restrictions, authorised labs for COVID-19 tests and vaccine information. It will have the option to enter personal data, such as vaccination information and tests undertaken. The government will accept the “OK to Travel” certification from this app as a validation for COVID-19 tests for travellers. <br>
*Data collection: You will be required to give the address of your accommodation and a contact telephone number. You will also be required to download a tracing application to your smartphone. <br>
*Testing requirements: Whilst tests can be carried out on arrival in Panama, some airlines may deny boarding a flight to Panama if you do not already have a negative COVID-19 test result. <br>
*If you’re fully vaccinated: Panama classifies travellers as fully vaccinated or not fully vaccinated. If you’re fully vaccinated, you can enter Panama without needing to test or quarantine. To be considered ‘fully vaccinated’ you must have proof of a completed vaccination programme (see proof of vaccination status) and must complete the traveller affidavit form before entering the country. If you are a seaman, you should physically present your vaccination card with the required doses at your port of entry. <br>
At least 14 days must have passed since your second dose of the vaccine and the vaccine must be approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centre for Disease Control (CDC). Find out if you qualify as fully vaccinated in Panama on the <a href=""https://www.minsa.gob.pa/destacado/coronavirus-covid-19"">Panamanian Ministry of Health website</a> (in Spanish). <br>
*Proof of vaccination status: You must present proof that you have been fully vaccinated to qualify for entry to Panama as a vaccinated traveller. If you do not have proof, you will be treated as if you’re not vaccinated. <br>
Panama will accept proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered at least 14 days prior to travel. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
*If you’re not fully vaccinated: You are considered ‘not fully vaccinated’ if you have not received all doses necessary to complete a vaccination program in the country where you were vaccinated or have received no doses. If you are not fully vaccinated you must take a COVID-19 test 72 hours before arrival and show proof of a negative PCR / antigen result or have a test carried out at the port of entry, at your own cost. <br>Whilst tests can be carried out on arrival in Panama, some airlines may deny boarding a flight to Panama if you do not already have a negative COVID-19 test result. <br>
Once you arrive in Panama, you will need to take another test and quarantine for 10 days. You will need to quarantine at your own accommodation or at a place indicated by the Panamanian Ministry of Health. You can choose to take a PCR test on day 4. If the test is negative you can leave quarantine. <br>

*Children and young people: Children under 12 years of age are exempt from any type of testing and quarantine if their parents, care givers or guardians comply with the COVID-19 entry requirements to enter Panama. <br>
*If you’re transiting through Panama: Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination. Unless you meet entry requirements for Panama, you will not be allowed to leave the airport during your transit. Check with your airline before departing.

 Internal Restrictions: <br> 
*Travel in Panama: You should monitor the press and <a href=""https://www.yomeinformopma.org/"">official announcements of the Panamanian government</a> to ensure you are up to date with any changes to COVID-19 restrictions.<br>
Measures in place to combat the spread of COVID-19 vary by province, including curfews. Travel restrictions between provinces may be introduced at short notice. You may be randomly tested for COVID-19 if you are stopped. The police and security forces are empowered to enforce restrictions on movements and events due to the current state of emergency. You must follow their instructions. Domestic flights are operating. Airports, ports and borders remain open; proof of good health will be required at these entry points.<br>
