International Restrictions: <br>
*All travellers: You will not need a visa to enter or travel through Panama as a visitor. <br>
Panama encourages the use of the IATA Travel Pass app. This app will have up-to-date information on travel restrictions, authorised labs for COVID-19 tests and vaccine information. It will have the option to enter personal data, such as vaccination information and tests undertaken. The government will accept the “OK to Travel” certification from this app as a validation for COVID-19 tests for travellers. <br>
All restrictions or requirements around COVID-19 have been lifted. No need to present negative test results, vaccination scheme or declaration form. <br>
*Data collection: You will be required to give the address of your accommodation and a contact telephone number. <br>
*Children and young people: There are no specific requirements for children and young people. <br>
*If you’re transiting through Panama: Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination. <br>
Unless you meet entry requirements for Panama, you will not be allowed to leave the airport during your transit. Check with your airline before departing. <br>

 Internal Restrictions: <br> 
*Travel in Panama: You should monitor the press and <a href=""https://www.yomeinformopma.org/"">official announcements of the Panamanian government</a> to ensure you are up to date with any changes to COVID-19 restrictions.<br>
Measures in place to combat the spread of COVID-19 vary by province, including curfews. Travel restrictions between provinces may be introduced at short notice. You may be randomly tested for COVID-19 if you are stopped. The police and security forces are empowered to enforce restrictions on movements and events due to the current state of emergency. You must follow their instructions. Domestic flights are operating. Airports, ports and borders remain open; proof of good health will be required at these entry points.<br>
Make sure you check the local guidance from Panamanian authorities in your area. See the <a href=""https://www.atp.gob.pa/asistencia-y-licencias/covid-19/"">Ministry of Tourism website</a> (in Spanish), <a href=""https://twitter.com/minsapma"">Ministry of Health Twitter page</a> (in Spanish) and <a href=""https://www.visitpanama.com/information/travel-guidelines/"">Visit Panama website</a> (in English). <br>
*Public spaces and services: The wearing of masks inside enclosed or crowded areas is compulsory. You must wear a mask on buses and the metro as well as in public and private medical facilities. <br>
Many venues – such as restaurants, bars, museums and other social events - have reduced capacity, although the consumption of alcohol is permitted. Restrictions may be amended based on vaccination status and some venues are requesting proof of full vaccination as a condition of entry. Respect the limits posted on signs at venues.<br>
Some sporting events may require you to <a href=""https://www.panamadigital.gob.pa/"">complete a QR code for “Safe Mobility”</a> before entering the event. You must adhere to safety measures including the use of face masks and social distancing.
