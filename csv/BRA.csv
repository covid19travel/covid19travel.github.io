*Travel in Brazil: On 23 November 2022 the Brazilian government reinstated the requirement to use face masks inside airports and on flights as a safety precaution to limit the spread of COVID-19. You should check the website of the airport you are flying into or transiting through to see how this could affect you.
A number of Brazilian states no longer mandate the use of face masks and face coverings while in public. However, the guidance may vary from state to state and there can often be different rules within different cities. You should refer to official guidance in your location for details of what preventative measures are in place and how you can comply with them.
There are additional local rquirements to show proof of vaccination in order to access certain places, such private venues, including hotels, restaurants and gyms. The precise requirements may vary from venue to venue so you should check on compliancy requirements in advance. <br>
*Accommodation: Hotels are operating at capacities dictated by local rules and regulations. <br>
*Public spaces and services: Some states and cities have reinstated the requirement to wear a mask on public transport. The situation varies around Brazil. Each state will determine local measures to limit the spread of COVID-19, and this includes regulation on public transport and on the opening of non-essential services (shops, restaurants, bars, beaches and other leisure activities). You should refer to official guidance in your location for details of what preventative measures are in place and how you can comply with them. <br>
