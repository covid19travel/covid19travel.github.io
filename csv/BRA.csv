 *Entry by land: Brazil has closed some of its land borders, except to Brazilian citizens, resident foreign nationals and foreign spouses, children, parents or guardians of a Brazilian national. The land border with Paraguay is now open. <br>
Transiting: If you’re in a bordering country and need to cross the land border to board a flight back to your country of residence, you should get in touch with your Embassy or Consular. You will be permitted to enter Brazil with authorisation from the Federal Police following an official request from the Embassy and on presentation of flight tickets. You should travel straight to the airport once in Brazil. <br>
*Sea ports: As of 1 November 2021, cruise ships following an entirely domestic itinerary are allowed to resume operation along the Brazilian coast. The Brazilian government continues to suspend the entry of international cruise ships and foreigners disembarking in any port or other maritime location in Brazil regardless of nationality. These restrictions do not apply to resident foreigners and foreign spouses, children, parents or custodians of a Brazilian national.
Disembarking will only be permitted when medical assistance is required or to catch a connecting flight back to the country of residence. <br>
*Transiting Brazil: Passengers are allowed to freely transit as long as they do not leave the international airport area and have a ticket for onward travel. If you intend to transit by land, please read Entry by land. <br>

 Internal Restrictions:<br>
 *Travel in Brazil: Restrictions vary from city to city. The use of face masks in streets, public spaces such as parks, and on public transport including taxis is mandatory across the country. There are additional local requirements to show proof of vaccination and/or for the compulsory use of masks in certain places, such as shops, cinemas and gyms, in various cities including São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte and Brasília. <br>
Social isolation measures have been lifted to an extent in some parts of the country, but localised lockdowns continue to varying degrees. You should refer to official guidance in your location for details of what preventative measures are in place and how you can comply with them. Failing to comply with these rules may result in a fine. <br>
*Accommodation: Some accommodation options are open such as hotels, hostels and private rentals but this varies area by area. Some popular beach areas remain closed to non-residents. Check with your accommodation provider what facilities, including restaurants, are available.
*Public spaces and services: The situation varies around Brazil, each state will determine local measures to limit the spread of COVID-19, and this includes regulation on the opening of non-essential services (shops, restaurants, bars, beaches and other leisure activities). You should refer to official guidance in your location for details of what preventative measures are in place and how you can comply with them. It’s highly possible that public places likely to attract large crowds may be closed at short notice. <br>
*If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
