*Entry by land: Brazil has re-opened all of its land boarders. For entry by land, travellers are required to present evidence of a negative PCR or Antigen test, as well as proof of full COVID-19 vaccination. However, unlike the requirements for those arriving by air, foreign travellers arriving by land without proof of vaccination are only permitted entry if they are seeking to transit through Brazil to their country of ordinary residence. <br>
Transiting: If you are in a bordering country and need to cross the land border to board a flight back to your country of residence, you should get in touch with the  Embassy or Consulate. You will be permitted to enter Brazil with authorisation from the Federal Police following an official request from the Embassy and on presentation of flight tickets. You should travel straight to the airport once in Brazil. <br>
*Sea ports: Following a recommendation from the Brazilian National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA), the Brazilian Government has temporarily suspended domestic cruise ships from operating along the Brazilian coast. Given the fluid coronavirus situation globally, such cruises are likely to remain subject to disruption at short notice throughout 2022. <br>
The Brazilian government continues to suspend the entry of all international cruise ships and prohibits most foreigners from disembarking at any port or other maritime location in Brazil regardless of nationality. These restrictions do not apply to resident foreigners and foreign spouses, children, parents or custodians of a Brazilian national. Disembarkation will only be permitted when medical assistance is required or to catch a connecting flight back to the passenger’s country of residence. <br>
*Transiting Brazil: Passengers are allowed to freely transit as long as they do not leave the international airport area and have a ticket for onward travel. If you intend to transit by land, please read Entry by land. <br>
*Visas: From 3 November 2020, the Brazilian government resumed counting visitor length of stay. They had previously suspended this at the start of the pandemic. Anyone whose 90 days immigration deadline would have fallen between the suspension period of 16 March 2020 to 2 November 2020 will not be fined. If your 90 days expired on 3 November 2020 or later, you might be fined for overstaying. If you wish to extend your tourist visa, you should contact the <a href=""https://www.gov.br/pf/pt-br/assuntos/imigracao"">Policia Federal</a>. <br>
  <br> 
 Internal Restrictions:<br>
 *Travel in Brazil: Restrictions vary from city to city.<br>
The use of face masks in streets, public spaces such as parks, and on public transport including taxis is mandatory across the country.<br>
There are additional local requirements to show proof of vaccination and/or for the compulsory use of masks in certain places, such as shops, cinemas and gyms. These are in force, in various cities including São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte and Brasília. <br>
Social isolation measures have been lifted to an extent in some parts of the country, but localised lockdowns continue to varying degrees. You should refer to official guidance in your location for details of what preventative measures are in place and how you can comply with them. Failing to comply with these rules may result in a fine. <br>
*Accommodation: Some accommodation options are open such as hotels, hostels and private rentals but this varies area by area. Some popular beach areas remain closed to non-residents. Check with your accommodation provider what facilities, including restaurants, are available. <br>
Public spaces and services: The situation varies around Brazil, each state will determine local measures to limit the spread of COVID-19, and this includes regulation on the opening of non-essential services (shops, restaurants, bars, beaches and other leisure activities). You should refer to official guidance in your location for details of what preventative measures are in place and how you can comply with them. It’s highly possible that public places likely to attract large crowds may be closed at short notice. For example, several cities have decided not to host the traditional street Carnival in 2022. These include Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Recife and Salvador, although controlled events are still expected to take place.
*If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
