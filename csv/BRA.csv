Entry by land: Brazil has re-opened all of its land boarders. For entry by land, travellers are required to present evidence of a negative PCR or Antigen test. All travellers aged 18 or over must present proof of full COVID-19 vaccination. However, unlike the requirements for those arriving by air, foreign travellers arriving by land without proof of vaccination are only permitted entry if they are seeking to transit through Brazil to their country of ordinary residence. <br>
Transiting: If you are in a bordering country and need to cross the land border to board a flight back to your country of residence, you should get in touch with the British Embassy or Consulate. You will be permitted to enter Brazil with authorisation from the Federal Police following an official request from the Embassy and on presentation of flight tickets. You should travel straight to the airport once in Brazil. <br>
*Sea ports: Following a recommendation from the Brazilian National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA), the Brazilian Government has temporarily suspended domestic cruise ships from operating along the Brazilian coast. Given the fluid coronavirus situation globally, such cruises are likely to remain subject to disruption at short notice throughout 2022. <br>
The Brazilian government continues to suspend the entry of all international cruise ships and prohibits most foreigners from disembarking at any port or other maritime location in Brazil regardless of nationality. These restrictions do not apply to resident foreigners and foreign spouses, children, parents or custodians of a Brazilian national. Disembarkation will only be permitted when medical assistance is required or to catch a connecting flight back to the passenger’s country of residence. <br>
*Transiting Brazil: Passengers are allowed to freely transit as long as they do not leave the international airport area and have a ticket for onward travel. If you intend to transit by land, please read Entry by land.<br>
<br>
 <br> 
 Internal Restrictions:<br>
*Travel in Brazil: A number of Brazilian states no longer mandate the use of face masks and face coverings while in public. However, the guidance may vary from state to state and there can often be different rules within different cities. You should refer to official guidance in your location for details of what preventative measures are in place and how you can comply with them. <br>
There are additional local requirements to show proof of vaccination in order to access certain places, such private venues, including hotels, restaurants and gyms. The precise requirements may vary from venue to venue so you should check on compliancy requirements in advance. <br>
*Accommodation: Hotels are operating at capacities dictated by local rules and regulations.<br>
*Public spaces and services: The situation varies around Brazil. Each state will determine local measures to limit the spread of COVID-19, and this includes regulation on public transport and on the opening of non-essential services (shops, restaurants, bars, beaches and other leisure activities). You should refer to official guidance in your location for details of what preventative measures are in place and how you can comply with them.<br>
