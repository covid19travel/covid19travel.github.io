Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Travel in Andorra: The Andorran authorities have various restrictions in place including social distancing of 1.5m unless specific protocols are in place. The use of a mask is not mandatory in public spaces and on urban roads, provided that there are no crowds of people that do not allow you to maintain the minimum distance of 1.5 meters. The use of face masks is mandatory in enclosed public premises such as bars, restaurants, shops and cultural establishments, among others. All people eight years old and over are required to wear masks. <br>
Groups of up to 10 people are able to meet indoors and up to 20 in outdoor spaces, including in private spaces. Limits to capacity are also in place in shops and other places of interest, and you should follow the instructions displayed locally. Similar restrictions are in place in gyms and sports centres. Smoking is not permitted in any public area. <br>
A COVID certificate must be shown by those 16 years of age and over to access most public places, including bars, restaurants, tourist accommodation, spas and other tourism activities. The Andorran authorities consider either a vaccination certificate, a recovery certificate, or a negative diagnostic test as an acceptable COVID certificate. A COVID certificate must also be presented in all of Andorra’s skiing areas: this applies to all those taking part in a sporting activity (including downhill skiing, snowshoeing and other activities) as well as those wishing to enter ski lifts, restaurants and enclosed spaces. <br>
You can find more information regarding the measures in place on the <a href=""https://visitandorra.com/en/covid-19-in-andorra/"">Andorran government website</a>. <br>
*Accepted forms of COVID certificate: Proof of vaccination status. Andorra will accept proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. It will also accept proof of COVID-19 vaccination record issued in the Crown Dependencies. Documents can be in English, Spanish, French or Catalan and in paper or electronic format. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and cannot be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
At least 14 days must have passed since being fully vaccinated (with both doses of a two-dose vaccine or one dose of a single-dose vaccine). Your date(s) of vaccination must be specified and your final dose must have been administered within the last 270 days. If you completed your vaccination (with both doses of a two-dose vaccine or one dose of a single-dose vaccine) more than 270 days ago, you must be able to show proof of having received a booster jab. There is no requirement for 14 days to have passed since receiving your booster jab. <br>
*Diagnostic test: The Andorran authorities accept either a TMA or PCR diagnostic certificate with a negative result carried out within the previous 72 hours, or a certificate of a negative result for an antigen test performed within the previous 12 hours. <br>
The accrediting documentation may be written in Catalan, Spanish, French or English, can be presented in digital or physical format and must contain at least the following information: name and surname(s) of holder, issuing country, date and time of sample and test type. <br>
*Recovery certificate: Under the Andorran rules, a recovery certificate must be issued by the competent authority or a medical service at least 11 days after the first positive TMA or PCR test. This certificate is valid for 180 calendar days from the date the sample was taken for this TMA or PCR test. <br>
The accrediting documentation may be written in English, Spanish, French or Catalan, can be presented in digital or physical format and must contain at least the following information: name and surname(s) of holder, date of sample of first test with positive result, test type and issuing country. Children under the age of 16 are exempt from presenting the certificate, but must follow preventive measures.
