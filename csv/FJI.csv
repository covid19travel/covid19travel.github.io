  International Restrictions: <br>
  *Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19): The Fiji government has announced changes to International travel due to COVID-19. The Fiji border remains closed to British tourists. Only residents and Fijian citizens are allowed to return to Fiji. Ahead of travel, returning residents and non-Fiji citizens must request approval from the Office of the Prime Minister for entry (by air or sea) into Fiji. Contact the Office of the Prime Minister by email: borderrequest@immi.gov.fj. Further information can be found on the <a href=""http://www.immigration.gov.fj/"">Fiji government website</a>. All foreign nationals who are currently stranded in Fiji have been advised to contact Fiji Immigration Office so that they could be properly guided to maintain their legal status. This applies to all categories of permit holders. These restrictions supersede the regular entry requirements set out below which refer to Fiji’s requirements that existed before the border was closed.

  Internal Restrictions: <br>
 *Travel in Fiji: A nationwide curfew is in effect from 11pm to 4am each night. Gatherings are no longer restricted to a hard limit of 100 persons, but venues are required to limit capacity by half. This applies to weddings, funerals, conferences, community gatherings, cafes and restaurants. Fiji’s authorities are encouraging social distancing, good hand hygiene and are urging those who have cold/flu symptoms to stay at home. Fiji government is also encouraging residents to download the careFiji contact tracing app. In some instances, such as at the airport, you will need to show you have this on your phone. Full details on the government’s response can be found on the <a href=""https://www.health.gov.fj/covid-19-updates"">Ministry of Health and Medical services website</a>. If you’re looking to leave Fiji and are visiting the outer islands, you’re advised to return to the main island of Viti Levu immediately. Further cases of COVID-19 in Fiji could see the reintroduction of restrictions on internal travel and/or a lockdown of affected areas. More information on the latest restrictions are available on the <a href=""https://www.fiji.gov.fj/Media-Centre/News"">Fiji government website</a>. <br>
 *Accommodation: Some hotels and rental accommodation are open, and social distancing measures are in place.<br>
