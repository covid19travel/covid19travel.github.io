  International Restrictions: <br>
  *Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19): The Fiji government has announced changes to International travel due to COVID-19. The Fiji border remains closed to British tourists. Only residents and Fijian citizens are allowed to return to Fiji. Ahead of travel, returning residents and non-Fiji citizens must request approval from the Office of the Prime Minister for entry (by air or sea) into Fiji. Contact the Office of the Prime Minister by email: borderrequest@immi.gov.fj. Further information can be found on the <a href=""http://www.immigration.gov.fj/"">Fiji government website</a>. All foreign nationals who are currently stranded in Fiji have been advised to contact Fiji Immigration Office so that they could be properly guided to maintain their legal status. This applies to all categories of permit holders. These restrictions supersede the regular entry requirements set out below which refer to Fiji’s requirements that existed before the border was closed.

Travel between the West (Nadi, Lautoka and surrounding areas) and other parts of Viti Levu is very limited. Religious services, sporting events and non-work gatherings are suspended. Schools are closed for three weeks. Many businesses continue to operate but require customers to display their careFiji app or register their details for contact tracing purpose. High-risk businesses such as gyms, cafes, bars, and amusement arcades will be closed for the 14 day period. Domestic passenger flights and boat services to and from Viti Levu are suspended from 22 April. International flights are suspended until further notice for all passenger air travel into and out of Fiji for non-medical purposes. The Fijian government is encouraging people to work from home, and to leave their houses only if essential.<br>
A nationwide curfew is in effect from 11pm to 4am each night. Gatherings are no longer restricted to a hard limit of 100 persons, but venues are required to limit capacity by half. This applies to weddings, funerals, conferences, community gatherings, cafes and restaurants. Fiji’s authorities are encouraging social distancing, good hand hygiene and are urging those who have cold/flu symptoms to stay at home. Fiji government is also encouraging residents to download the careFiji contact tracing app. In some instances, such as at the airport, you will need to show you have this on your phone.

If you’re looking to leave Fiji and are visiting the outer islands, you’re advised to return to the main island of Viti Levu immediately. Further cases of COVID-19 in Fiji could see the reintroduction of restrictions on internal travel and/or a lockdown of affected areas. More information on the latest restrictions are available on the <a href=""https://www.fiji.gov.fj/Media-Centre/News"">Fiji government website</a>.<br>
