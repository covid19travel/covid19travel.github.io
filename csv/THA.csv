You will be required to wear a face mask and follow other disease control measures when using public transport, including planes, trains, buses and taxis.

The Thai government also advises that you should avoid unnecessary travel and crowded places, and scan the ‘Thai Chana’ QR code where available. A number of disease control measures at national and local levels are also in place. These include a colourrating for each of Thailand’s 76 provinces based on the number of COVID-19 cases. Restrictions in each province depend on the colour rating and any additional local rules, and they may change at any time. The following six provinces are at the highest level (Dark Red) from Saturday 1st May: Bangkok, Chonburi, Chiang Mai, Nonthaburi, Pathum Thani and Samut Prakan. If you are in a Dark Red province, you must refrain from leaving your province unless it is necessary.
