Mask wearing is a voluntary practice. However, the Ministry of Public Health continues to recommend that you wear a mask in a crowded or badly ventilated area such as public transportation, hospitals, elderly care homes, and kindergarten. Inside public buildings, you will need to wear a mask unless you are by yourself or are doing activities in which a mask cannot be worn.

*Accommodation: Hotel and private rental accommodation is available throughout Thailand. However, some hotels, services, and facilities may remain closed. <br>
Hotels may take your temperature on arrival and ask you to provide information on your recent travel history and any symptoms you may have related to COVID-19. You may also need to follow other disease control measures implemented by the hotel. We advise you to contact hotels directly when booking. <br>
