International Restrictions: <br>
*All travellers: From 1 July, you are no longer required to apply for permission to enter Thailand. You still need to show proof of either a vaccine certificate or negative COVID-19 test results. <br>
Vaccine certificate or pro-ATK/RT-PCR results (within 72 hours) will be checked by airline staff at check-in and once again when you arrive in Thailand. USD 10,000 insurance requirements for COVID-19 treatment will no longer be mandatory, but is highly recommended. <br>
*If you’re fully vaccinated: You must show proof of your vaccination status. <br>
*Proof of vaccination status: All persons aged 18 or over must have a vaccination certificate. <br>
Thailand will accept COVID-19 vaccination records and COVID-19 recovery certificates. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered at least 14 days prior to travel. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
*If you’re not fully vaccinated: If you are not fully vaccinated, you must have proof of a negative result from an RT-PCR test or professional lateral flow test within 72 hours of travel. If you arrive without a negative test result, you are required to follow the public health instructions and guidelines as deemed appropriate by the Health Control officer at the point of arrival. All expenses incurred will be the responsibility of the traveller. <br>
 If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year: Entry requirements for Thailand are the same for all travellers, regardless of whether you have tested positive for COVID-19 in the past year. <br>
Residents of Thailand: If you have a Thai resident visa and usually live in Thailand but you cannot return within the required year, the Thailand authorities will grant you an extension to your compulsory return deadline. You must return to Thailand as soon as you can. <br>

Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Travel in Thailand: Domestic travel options within Thailand are available but remain subject to disease control measures. If you are taking an internal flight in Thailand, you may be asked to download an app or complete additional travel documentation. <br>
From 23 June, mask wearing is a voluntary practice. However, the Ministry of Public Health continues to recommend that you wear a mask in a crowded or badly ventilated place such as public transportation. You should wear a mask if you have COVID-19 symptoms or you are in a high risk group. Inside public buildings, you will need to wear a mask unless you are by yourself or are doing activities in which a mask cannot be worn.

and <a href=""https://thailand.prd.go.th/main.php?filename=index"">PR website</a> .
*Accommodation: Hotel and private rental accommodation is available throughout Thailand. However, some hotels remain closed so we advise you to contact hotels directly when booking. <br>
The majority of hotels will ask to take your temperature on arrival and ask you to provide information on your recent travel history and any symptoms you may have related to COVID-19. You may also need to follow other disease control measures.  Some services and facilities in hotels may not be available e.g. leisure facilities. <br>
*If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
