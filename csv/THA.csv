Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Travel in Thailand: Domestic travel options within Thailand are available but remain subject to disease control measures. These may include restrictions on movement between provinces. <br>
If you are taking an internal flight in Thailand, you may be asked to download an app or complete additional travel documentation. <br>
You will be required to wear a face mask and follow other disease control measures when using public transport, including planes, trains, buses and taxis. In some provinces public transport may stop earlier than normal or have less capacity than normal. <br>
*COVID-related restrictions in Thailand: An emergency decree is currently in place. This includes instructions that you must not: <br>
•        enter high risk areas <br>
•        hoard essential goods <br>
•        attend public gatherings <br>
•        propagate false information <br>
Until further notice you must also wear a mask in all indoor and outdoor public spaces in Thailand and in vehicles if you are with others. If you do not wear a mask you may have to pay a fine. <br>
The Thai government also advises that you should avoid unnecessary travel and crowded places, and scan the ‘Thai Chana’ QR code where available. <br>
A number of disease control measures at national and local levels are also in place. These include a colour rating for each of Thailand’s 76 provinces based on the number of COVID-19 cases. Restrictions in each province and for movement between provinces depend on the colour rating and any additional local rules, and they may change at any time. <br>
In some provinces measures may include restrictions on dining in restaurants, gathering in groups, closures of shops and curfews. You are advised to follow all preventative and disease control measures to minimise risks and avoid penalties. <br>
Measures change frequently. You should check the current situation with local authorities and the <ahref=""https://www.facebook.com/thailandprd/videos/620249802706637/"">Thai government’s Facebook page</a> and <a href=""https://thailand.prd.go.th/main.php?filename=index"">PR website.</a> 
*Accommodation: Hotel and private rental accommodation is available throughout Thailand. However, some hotels remain closed so we advise you to contact hotels directly when booking. <br>
The majority of hotels will ask to take your temperature on arrival and ask you to provide information on your recent travel history and any symptoms you may have related to COVID-19. You may also need to follow other disease control measures. <br>
Some services and facilities in hotels may not be available e.g. leisure facilities. <br>
*If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there
*Health:  If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms, you should call the Thai COVID-19 Hotline on 1422. <br>
If you need a COVID-19 test, Thailand’s Ministry of Public Health has compiled a<a href=""https://service.dmsc.moph.go.th/labscovid19/indexen.php"">list of private and government-managed testing facilities</a> . These will provide you with a test and normally contact you afterwards with the result. Authorities may also contact you as part of their tracing process.
If you test positive for COVID-19 and have mild symptoms or are asymptomatic, Thai authorities recommend that you self-isolate at home or in a community setting dedicated to this such as a school or temple, where you can receive appropriate care. This also applies to school age children. National Health Security Office (NHSO) provides medical support and services for home isolation. To register, you can call the 1330 hotline. <br>
If you have more severe symptoms Thai public health regulations require that you quarantine at either a hospital, hospitel (a repurposed hotel with medical capabilities) or field hospital. <br>
You should ensure that you understand your health care provider’s policies before you take a test as these will include where you quarantine and receive medical care if you test positive. <br>
In areas designated as dark red zones there is increasing pressure on medical services. You may find it difficult to access COVID-19 testing and medical care. <br>
