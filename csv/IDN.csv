*If you’re fully vaccinated: If you have received a full course of COVID-19 vaccination (at least 2 doses), you can enter Indonesia as follows: <br>
Those intending to purchase a “visa on arrival” should: <br>
•        install the Peduli Lindungi mobile application <br>
•        show proof of a full course of vaccination (those who cannot be vaccinated for health reasons are exempt as long as they can show proof of exemption) <br>
•        undergo a temperature check upon arrival and, if showing COVID-19 symptoms and / or a temperature above 37.5 degrees, a RT-PCR test. If you test positive, you may be taken to a hospital for treatment or an isolation centre at your own expense. If negative, fully vaccinated travellers can continue their journey <br>
Travellers who have received a full course of COVID-19 vaccinations and a booster do not need to have an antigen/PCR test to travel domestically. Travellers who have not received any booster vaccination may need to show a negative antigen/PCR test to travel domestically. Contact your airlines for further details <br>
*Proof of vaccination status: You must present proof of vaccination status to enter Indonesia and/or to travel domestically within Indonesia. <br>
You can use the COVID Pass to demonstrate your vaccination record when entering Indonesia. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
*Vaccine verification: Please note, the Indonesian Government recognises your Vaccine certification. Verification of your certificates for use on the Peduli Lindungi app is the responsibility of the Government of Indonesia (usually the Ministry of Health authorities on arrival at your port of entry). It is no longer possible for the British Embassy to provide this verification. <br>
*If you’re not fully vaccinated: If you’re not fully vaccinated and are medically exempt, you will need to produce your exemption documents at check in (according to your airline policy) and on arrival in Jakarta. <br>
*If you’ve had COVID-19: If you have had COVID-19 and recovered within 30 days prior to departure, you are exempt from the requirement to show proof of vaccination and negative RT-PCR prior to departure. However, you will be required to take a RT-PCR test upon arrival and show the recovery certificate from a hospital in your country of origin. <br>
Indonesia’s Directorate General of Immigration (DGI) is no longer automatically extending expired visas or stay permits under COVID-19 emergency arrangements. In country KITAS application is no longer available. <br>
Children and young people: Children aged 12 to 17 follow the same rules as fully or partly vaccinated travellers. <br>
*If you’re transiting through Indonesia: Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination. <br>
Transiting through Indonesia is permitted for travellers who remain airside. Passengers will need to receive approval from the port health authority before continuing their journey. They should have evidence of their vaccination status, PCR test results and onward flight details ready for inspection. <br>
If you are transiting through Indonesia on your way to another country and will be passing through immigration (sometimes known as a layover), for example to stay in a hotel for a flight the next day, you will need to follow the requirements for a visitor.<br>
 <br>
