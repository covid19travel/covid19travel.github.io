From 17 December 2021 to 9 January 2022, anyone who has not had at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccination or who does not have proof of a negative PCR test performed in the preceding 48 hours will be subject to a curfew between 7pm and 6am. Some exemptions apply, including to some government workers and the diplomatic corps. <br>
Entry to touristic institutions, restaurants and hotels is limited to individuals who have had at least one COVID-19 vaccination or who have evidence of a negative PCR result from within the previous 48 hours. Capacity at all establishments is limited to 50%. Masks should be worn at all times inside venues, except when sat down to consume food and drink.
Taxis and private cars should have no more than four people in them (including the driver). Buses are allowed to operate with a maximum capacity of 50%.  Fabric masks covering the mouth and nose must be worn when outside the home and in vehicles (unless travelling alone). <br>
Lebanese authorities may issue fines, impose road blocks, or imprison those violating these measures for up to three years. You should comply with all measures introduced by the Lebanese authorities and obey the instructions of the security forces. These measures may be changed at short notice. <br>
Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans. <br>
*Accommodation: Hotels and private rentals are available. You should check that accommodation is open and receiving guests before booking, and request information on the measures being taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and on their fuel situation. Many businesses have closed due to the economic crisis. <br>
*If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there. <br>
The Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) is responsible for COVID-19 testing at the airport and will inform you by text if you tested positive on arrival. If you test positive you will be expected to self-isolate in your accommodation. The MOPH or hospital where you got tested will pass on your details to the local authorities, and you may get contacted by the local municipality and offered support, but this is not guaranteed. We would not expect unaccompanied minors to be treated any differently from others.
