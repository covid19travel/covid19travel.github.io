 Internal Restrictions: <br> 
*Travel in Lebanon: COVID-19 lockdown measures have been largely lifted, although they can change at short notice. Contact the Lebanese embassy for more information if you are not sure about COVID-19 measures in Lebanon. <br>
Beirut International airport remains operational although it is sometimes affected by fuel shortages, which can cause air conditioning or lighting to be turned off in the terminal buildings. Fuel shortages may affect the reliability of taxis to and from the airport. You should pre-book and confirm prior to travel. All passengers are required to have their tickets with them when transferring to and from the airport. Some exemptions to COVID-19 restrictions are applied to aid workers. For further clarification, aid workers should contact their employer for advice. <br>
Taxis and private cars should have no more than four people in them (including the driver). Buses are allowed to operate with a maximum capacity of 50%. <br>
Fabric masks covering the mouth and nose must be worn when outside the home and in vehicles (unless travelling alone). <br>
Lebanese authorities may issue fines, impose road blocks, or imprison those violating these measures for up to three years. You should comply with all measures introduced by the Lebanese authorities and obey the instructions of the security forces. These measures may be changed at short notice. <br>
Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans. <br>
*Accommodation: Hotels and private rentals are available. You should check that accommodation is open and receiving guests before booking, and request information on the measures being taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and on their fuel situation.
*If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
The Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) is responsible for COVID-19 testing at the airport and will inform you by text if you tested positive on arrival. If you test positive you will be expected to self-isolate in your accommodation. The MOPH or hospital where you got tested will pass on your details to the local authorities, and you may get contacted by the local municipality and offered support, but this is not guaranteed. We would not expect unaccompanied minors to be treated any differently from others. <br>
