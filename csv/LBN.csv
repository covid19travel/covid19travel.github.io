The Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) is responsible for COVID-19 testing at the airport and will inform you by text if you tested positive on arrival. If you test positive you will be expected to self-isolate in your accommodation. The MOPH or hospital where you got tested will pass on your details to the local authorities, and you may get contacted by the local municipality and offered support, but this is not guaranteed. We would not expect unaccompanied minors to be treated any differently from others.
