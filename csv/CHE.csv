Internal Restrictions: <br>
*COVID-19 restrictions: Switzerland has put measures in place to limit the spread of COVID-19. You should follow the <a href=""http://www.bag.admin.ch/protect-yourself-and-others"">rules on hygiene and social distancing</a>. <br>
People aged 12 or over must wear face masks in enclosed areas of public vehicles, as well as in publicly accessible indoor areas of hospitals and clinics, retirement and care homes. Failure to wear a mask is punishable by a fine. Children under the age of 12 are exempt from this requirement, as are individuals who are unable to wear a mask for medical reasons. <br>
Anyone who tests positive for the coronavirus during their stay in Switzerland must self-isolate for 5 days. Details can be found on the Isolation and contact page of the Federal Office of Public Health. Further information is available on the <a href=""https://www.bag.admin.ch/bag/en/home/krankheiten/ausbrueche-epidemien-pandemien/aktuelle-ausbrueche-epidemien/novel-cov/masken.html#11550956"">Federal Office of Public Health website</a>. <br>
Switzerland will accept proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. You will also need to show photographic ID (e.g. passport, driving licence). If you are travelling with a printed PDF proof of vaccination status, it must date from 1 November 2021 to ensure that the certificate can be scanned successfully, if domestic certification is required. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
Vaccinated visitors who don’t have an EU Digital COVID Certificate (EUDCC) or a certificate that is compatible with the EUDCC (e.g. the NHS COVID Pass) can apply online for a Swiss COVID certificate. This costs CHF 30. Applications take 5 working days to be processed. Further information is available on the <a href=""https://covidcertificate-form.admin.ch/foreign"">application website</a>.
