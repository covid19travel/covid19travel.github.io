Internal Restrictions: <br>
COVID-19 restrictions: Switzerland has put measures in place to limit the spread of COVID-19. <br>
You should follow the <a href=""http://www.bag.admin.ch/protect-yourself-and-others"">rules on hygiene and social distancing</a>. These include: <br>
•        Keeping a distance of at least 1.5 metres from other people<br>
•        If it is not possible to maintain that distance, wearing a face mask<br>
The requirement to wear a mask applies in all situations where a certificate requirement applies, including public transport and indoors in publicly accessible areas - except at private gatherings. Further information on masks is available on the <a href=""https://www.bag.admin.ch/bag/en/home/krankheiten/ausbrueche-epidemien-pandemien/aktuelle-ausbrueche-epidemien/novel-cov/masken.html#11550956"">Federal Office of Public Health website</a>. Failure to wear a mask is punishable by a fine. Children under the age of 12 are exempt from this requirement, as are individuals who are unable to wear a mask for medical reasons.<br>
Proof of vaccination, proof of recovery from a COVID-19 infection or a negative test result (up to 48 hours for a rapid antigen test or 72 hours for a PCR test) is required for entry into:<br>
•        Large-scale outdoor events attended by over 300 people. Indoor hospitality venues including restaurants, bars, clubs and discos<br>

Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.<br>
Vaccinated visitors who don’t have an EU Digital COVID Certificate (EUDCC) or a certificate that is compatible with the EUDCC (e.g. the NHS COVID Pass) can apply online for a Swiss COVID certificate. This costs CHF 30. Applications take 5 working days to be processed. Further information is available on the <a href=""https://covidcertificate-form.admin.ch/foreign"">application website</a>.
