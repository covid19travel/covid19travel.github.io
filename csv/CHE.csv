<br> <br>
Internal Restrictions: <br>
Authorities extend quarantine, work-from-home rules until end of February (Reuters, 19.01.2022). <br>
You should follow the <a href=""http://www.bag.admin.ch/protect-yourself-and-others"">rules on hygiene and social distancing</a>. These include: <br>
•        Keeping a distance of at least 1.5 metres from other people<br>
•        If it is not possible to maintain that distance, wearing a face mask<br>
The requirement to wear a mask applies in all situations where a certificate requirement applies, including public transport and indoors in publicly accessible areas - except at private gatherings. Further information on masks is available on the <a href=""https://www.bag.admin.ch/bag/en/home/krankheiten/ausbrueche-epidemien-pandemien/aktuelle-ausbrueche-epidemien/novel-cov/masken.html#11550956"">Federal Office of Public Health website</a>. Failure to wear a mask is punishable by a fine. Children under the age of 12 are exempt from this requirement, as are individuals who are unable to wear a mask for medical reasons.<br>
Proof of vaccination, proof of recovery from a COVID-19 infection or a negative test result (up to 48 hours for a rapid antigen test or 72 hours for a PCR test) is required for entry into:<br>
•        Large-scale outdoor events attended by over 300 people. Indoor hospitality venues including restaurants, bars, clubs and discos<br>
•        Cultural, sporting and leisure activities indoors. This includes museums and libraries, leisure facilities, zoos, casinos, fitness centres and sports facilities, indoor pools and water parks<br>
•        Indoor events including theatre and cinema, concerts, sporting events and private events outside the home (e.g. weddings)<br>
•        Indoor gatherings of friends and family attended by 11 or more people will be subject to a certificate requirement.<br>
Children under the age of 16 are exempt from this requirement. Switzerland will accept proof of <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-covid-pass"">COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record</a>. You will also need to show photographic ID (e.g. passport, driving licence). If you are travelling with a printed PDF proof of vaccination status, it must date from 1 November to ensure that the certificate can be scanned successfully, if domestic certification is required. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.<br>
Vaccinated visitors who don’t have an EU Digital COVID Certificate (EUDCC) or a certificate that is compatible with the EUDCC (e.g. the NHS COVID Pass) can apply online for a Swiss COVID certificate. This costs CHF 30. Applications take 5 working days to be processed. Further information is available on the <a href=""https://covidcertificate-form.admin.ch/foreign"">application website</a>. Further information is available from the <a href=""https://www.bag.admin.ch/bag/en/home/krankheiten/ausbrueche-epidemien-pandemien/aktuelle-ausbrueche-epidemien/novel-cov/massnahmen-des-bundes.html"">Federal Office of Public Health</a>. Cantons may imposed further restrictions, and you should check <a href=""https://www.ch.ch/de/coronavirus/#informationen-und-kontakte-in-den-kantonen"">cantonal websites</a> for further details.<br>
