Airside transit through Uzbekistan is permitted for travellers but non vaccinated travellers will need to show proof of a negative PCR test (taken no more than 72 hours before arrival) to enter Uzbekistan, and who meet the requirements for the next country they are travelling to. <br>
If you are a tourist transiting Uzbekistan in a recreational vehicle or staying in tents/camping, you are responsible for your own registration. You should register online via the electronic registration system <a href=""http://www.emehmon.uz/"">Emehmon</a> within three days of arrival. During the online registration process there will be a tourist tax charge for each day of your stay. At the moment tourist tax can only be paid online by Uzbek debit card in local currency, therefore you should seek assistance from hotels or local tour operators.<br>

Internal Restrictions: <br>
*International travel: Commercial flights to and from the UK to Uzbekistan restarted in August, although they operate only twice per week. Flights to Frankfurt have also resumed and there is a daily flight to Istanbul. Check with your travel company or airline for the latest information.<br>
*Testing on departure: It may be necessary to obtain a ‘fit-to-fly’ negative PCR test to board flights at Tashkent Airport, dependent upon the country of next destination. Travellers should check the entry regulations at their destination and any transit points and obtain any required tests before travel. <br>

Public transport in cities has resumed and train travel between regions is now operating. Care should be taken if using taxis as some operators might not be fully complying with COVID-19 hygiene measures. <br>
Under measures introduced by the Uzbek authorities, anyone subject to quarantine or self-isolation who breaches such controls is liable to a minimum fine of 11 Million UZS (approximately £900) or up to 10 years imprisonment. <br>
*Accommodation: Hotels, motels and guest houses are open (but are subject to special health and safety rules) following the introduction of new restrictive measures to combat the Omicron variant.<br>
