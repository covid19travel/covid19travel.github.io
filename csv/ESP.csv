 Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Travel in Spain: You should follow the advice of the local authorities on how best to protect yourself and others, including any measures that they bring in to control the virus. On 25 October 2020, the Spanish government declared a nationwide State of Emergency which includes a national obligatory overnight curfew (specific curfew times vary, starting between 10pm and midnight and lasting until 6am). It also provides regional governments with legal powers to impose further mobility restrictions in their region if deemed necessary (e.g. entry and exit restrictions to and from specific areas). <br>
The situation is evolving and restrictive measures to control the virus may be introduced across the country at short notice. You will need to meet the requirements and be prepared to demonstrate with documentary evidence an essential need to enter Spain. You should <a href=""https://www.mscbs.gob.es/en/profesionales/saludPublica/ccayes/alertasActual/nCov/estrategia/medidasPrevCCAA.htm"">consult the Spanish Ministry of Health map</a> for details of local outbreaks and the specific measures in place in your destination. You should also check the advice of local authorities in your destination prior to travel. There are some exemptions to entering and exiting confined areas or travelling during the hours of curfew such as travel to your place of employment, attendance at medical appointments or transiting the area to return to your place of residence. Entry for tourism purposes is not currently permitted and should be avoided. <br>
Many municipal and regional authorities have introduced other types of measures such as limiting the opening hours and capacity of bars and restaurants, and in some places these remain closed until further notice.<br>
The use of face coverings is mandatory for anyone over the age of 6 years old on all forms of public transport in Spain and in many other indoor and outdoor public spaces. Rules on the use of face masks may vary by region.<br>
*Road travel: Land borders are open. The Spanish government has implemented testing requirements for those travelling overland from France into Spain by road or rail. The French government has implemented additional entry requirements for those travelling to and transiting through France. Portuguese authorities are enforcing border control checks at the land border with Spain. Only cross-border workers, goods traffic and those entering or exiting Portugal to return to their usual place of residence will be granted passage. Rail and ferry connections between Spain and Portugal have been suspended. On 25 October 2020, the Spanish government declared a nationwide State of Emergency which includes a national obligatory overnight curfew (specific curfew times vary, starting between 10pm and midnight and lasting until 6am). It also provides regional governments with legal powers to impose further mobility restrictions in their region if deemed necessary (e.g. entry and exit restrictions to and from specific areas). Inter-regional travel may be restricted if your point of origin and destination fall within a confined area where entry and exit restrictions are in place. You should check the advice of local authorities in your destination prior to travel. <br>
Transiting confined areas is permitted; however, you should be prepared to show evidence of your onward journey such as train or flight tickets to your final destination. <br>
If you need to travel during the hours of curfew, you should carry evidence of your reason for travel such as a certificate from your employer, proof of medical appointment, or proof of onward journey such as train or flight tickets. To find out more about specific exemptions you should refer to guidance from local authorities. <br>
If travelling with people who are not from the same household, all passengers must wear a face mask covering the nose and mouth. Penalties may be imposed if you do not comply. <br>
*Public spaces and services: Social distancing measures and other safety precautions should continue to be observed at all times. Many municipal and regional authorities have introduced other types of measures such as limiting the opening hours and capacity of bars and restaurants, and in some places, these remain closed until further notice. You should refer to local authorities for any additional measures where you are as this may vary from one region to the next. See the <a href=""https://www.mscbs.gob.es/profesionales/saludPublica/ccayes/alertasActual/nCov/estrategia/medidasPrevCCAA.htm"">Ministry of Health’s map of regional measures</a> (Spanish language only). <br>
Key common measures across Spain include: 
•        social gatherings are limited to a maximum of 6 people outdoors and a maximum of 4 people inside restaurants and bars. <br>
•        people from different households are not allowed to meet indoors in private homes (unless they have caring responsibilities for a dependent); <br>
•        social distancing of 1.5 metres. <br>
•        obligatory use of face masks in public spaces. <br>
•        abiding by any safety measures put in place by establishments such as hotels, bars, shops and restaurants to reduce the risk of COVID-19. <br>
•        track and trace – all shops, businesses and transport companies are obliged to keep customers’ contact information (where provided) for up to 4 weeks for tracking and tracing purposes.<br>
•        capacity restrictions in place at beaches or other public areas such as the delineation of plots and the use of booking systems. You should refer to local authorities for information on the measures in place. <br>
•        if visitors test positive or develop symptoms during their stay in Spain, they may be moved to specific designated accommodation to prevent further spread. <br>
•        wash your hands frequently and thoroughly and use hand sanitizer gel where soap and water is not available. <br>
*Use of face masks: The use of face coverings is mandatory for anyone over the age of 6 years old on all forms of public transport in Spain and in many other indoor and outdoor public spaces, even when social distancing of 1.5 metres is observed. <br>
Specific rules on the use of face masks may vary from one region to the next. You should refer to local authorities for advice. Penalties may be imposed if you do not comply. <br>
You should carry a face mask with you at all times and be prepared to wear it during your stay. Face masks must cover the nose and mouth. <br>
There are some exceptions to the use of face masks such as when practising sport, eating or drinking, or at the beach, however rules may vary from one region to the next. You should refer to local authorities for specific information on face-covering requirements and any exceptions where you are. <br>
Those with respiratory problems or those unable to wear a mask due to other health conditions or disabilities are exempt from this rule. More details are available from the <a href=""https://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2020/05/20/pdfs/BOE-A-2020-5142.pdf"">Ministry for Health</a> (in Spanish). <br>
While not mandatory, the use of face masks on children between 3 and 5 years of age is recommended.
