Regional governments retain legal powers to ease or tighten restrictions within their region if deemed necessary to control the spread of the virus (e.g. partial lockdowns; limiting the capacity and opening hours of retail, hospitality establishments and public events). <br>
Local and regional restrictions may be introduced at short notice. You should <a href=""https://cnecovid.isciii.es/covid19/"">consult regional incidence levels</a>, refer to the advice of local authorities in your destination and ensure you are aware of the specific measures in place prior to travel. <br>
The use of face coverings continues to be mandatory for anyone over the age of 6 years old on all forms of public transport in Spain, in any enclosed space open to the public, and outdoors where social distancing of 1.5 metres cannot be observed. Specific rules on the use of face masks may vary by region.<br>
*Road travel: Land borders are open: The Spanish government has implemented health requirements for those travelling overland from France into Spain by road or rail.  <br>
The French government has implemented additional entry requirements for those travelling to and transiting through France. If you are planning to drive from Spain through France, check the latest information ahead of your journey. Border controls at the Portugal land border with Spain have been lifted. <br>
Inter-regional travel may be restricted if your point of origin and destination fall within a confined area where entry and exit restrictions are in place. You should check the advice of local authorities in your destination prior to travel. Transiting confined areas is permitted; however, you should be prepared to show evidence of your onward journey such as train or flight tickets to your final destination. If travelling with people who are not from the same household, all passengers must wear a face mask covering the nose and mouth. Penalties may be imposed if you do not comply. <br>

•        capacity restrictions at beaches or other public areas such as the delineation of plots and the use of booking systems. You should refer to local authorities for information on the measures in place <br>
•        if visitors test positive or develop symptoms during their stay in Spain, they may be moved to specific designated accommodation to prevent further spread <br>
These measures may vary between regions. You should refer to local and regional authorities for advice. <br>
Spain will accept the COVID-19 vaccination record. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>

•        On all forms of public transport including planes, trains, trams, buses and metro, as well as all transport stations, platforms and airports. <br>
Specific rules on the use of face masks may vary between regions. You should refer to local authorities for specific information on face-covering requirements and any exceptions where you are. Penalties may be imposed if you do not comply. <br>
Those with respiratory problems or those unable to wear a mask due to other health conditions or disabilities are exempt from this rule. More details are available from the <a href=""https://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2020/05/20/pdfs/BOE-A-2020-5142.pdf"">Ministry for Health  </a> (in Spanish). <br>
