Internal Restrictions: <br> 
*Travel in Spain: You should follow the advice of the local authorities on how best to protect yourself and others, including any measures that they bring in to control the virus. <br>
Public health measures to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 remain in force across Spain and may vary between regions. Handwashing hygiene, air ventilation rules and the use of face masks both indoors and at some large outdoor events, must continue to be observed at all times. <br>
Regional governments retain legal powers to ease or tighten restrictions within their region if deemed necessary to control the spread of the virus (e.g. partial lockdowns; limiting the capacity and opening hours of retail, hospitality establishments and public events, COVID passports). <br>
Local and regional restrictions may be introduced at short notice. You should <a href=""https://cnecovid.isciii.es/covid19/"">consult regional incidence levels</a>, refer to the advice of local authorities in your destination and ensure you are aware of the specific measures in place prior to travel. <br>
*Road travel: Land borders are open. <br>
The Spanish government has implemented health requirements for those travelling overland from France into Spain by road or rail. <br>
The French government has implemented additional entry requirements for those travelling to and transiting through France. If you are planning to drive from Spain through France, check the latest  travel advice for France ahead of your journey. <br>
Border controls at the Portugal land border with Spain have been lifted. Check travel advice for Portugal for further information.
Inter-regional travel may be restricted if your point of origin and destination fall within a confined area where entry and exit restrictions are in place. You should check the advice of local authorities in your destination prior to travel. Transiting confined areas is permitted; however, you should be prepared to show evidence of your onward journey such as train or flight tickets to your final destination. <br>
If travelling with people who are not from the same household, all passengers must wear a face mask covering the nose and mouth. Penalties may be imposed if you do not comply. <br>
*Public spaces and services: Social distancing measures and other public safety precautions should continue to be observed at all times. You should refer to local authorities for any additional measures where you are as this may vary from one region to the next. You must continue to observe the following rules regardless of your whereabouts in Spain: <br>
•        social distancing of 1.5 metres <br>
•        obligatory use of face masks in enclosed public spaces and at some large outdoor events. <br>
•        abide by any safety measures put in place by establishments such as hotels, bars, shops and restaurants to reduce the risk of COVID-19 <b>
•        wash your hands frequently and thoroughly and use hand sanitizer gel where soap and water is not available <br>
Spanish regional authorities may also impose the following additional restrictive measures: <br>
•        a requirement to present a ‘Covid passport’ – a document certifying that you have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 – in order to access bars, restaurants, nightclubs, hospitals, care homes etc <br>
•        an overnight curfew (specific curfew times vary between regions) <br>
•        social gatherings may be limited (e.g. to a maximum of 6 people outdoors and a maximum of 4 people inside restaurants and bars) <br>
•        people from different households may not be permitted to meet indoors in private homes (unless they have caring responsibilities for a dependent) <br>
•        capacity restrictions at beaches or other public areas such as the delineation of plots and the use of booking systems. You should refer to local authorities for information on the measures in place <br>
•        if visitors test positive or develop symptoms during their stay in Spain, they may be moved to specific designated accommodation to prevent further spread <br>
These measures may vary between regions. You should refer to local and regional authorities for advice. <br>
Spain will accept the COVID-19 vaccination record. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
*Use of face masks: The use of face coverings is mandatory for anyone over the age of 6 years old on all forms of public transport in Spain and in many other indoor public spaces. Face masks are also mandatory at large, open air, standing events and seated events where social distancing of 1.5m cannot be observed. There are no other requirements to wear face masks outdoors. <br>
You should carry a face mask with you at all times and be prepared to wear it during your stay. Face masks must cover the nose and mouth. While not mandatory, the use of face masks on children between 3 and 5 years of age is recommended. <br>
As specific rules on the use of face masks may vary from one region to the next, you should refer to local authorities for advice. Penalties may be imposed if you do not comply. <br>
Those with respiratory problems or those unable to wear a mask due to other health conditions or disabilities are exempt. More details are available from the <a href=""https://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2020/05/20/pdfs/BOE-A-2020-5142.pdf""><Ministry for Health/a> (in Spanish).
*If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
