*Travel in Spain: On 25 October 2020, the Spanish government declared a nationwide State of Emergency which includes a national obligatory overnight curfew (specific curfew times vary, starting between 10pm and midnight and lasting until 6am).

The situation is evolving and restrictive measures to control the virus may be introduced across the country at short notice. Only Spanish citizens, those who are legally resident in Spain or those who can demonstrate an essential need to enter Spain, will be allowed to enter the country. If you meet one of the requirements and are prepared to demonstrate with documentary evidence an essential need to enter Spain, you should <a href=""https://www.mscbs.gob.es/en/profesionales/saludPublica/ccayes/alertasActual/nCov/estrategia/medidasPrevCCAA.htm"">consult the Spanish Ministry of Health map</a> for details of local outbreaks and the specific measures in place in your destination.

There are some exemptions to entering and exiting confined areas or travelling during the hours of curfew such as travel to your place of employment, attendance at medical appointments or transiting the area to return to your place of residence.
