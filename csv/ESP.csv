Internal Restrictions: <br> 
*Travel in Spain: You should follow the advice of the local authorities on how best to protect yourself and others, including any measures that they bring in to control the virus. <br>
Some public health measures to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 remain in force across Spain and may vary between regions. <br>
Regional governments retain legal powers to ease or tighten restrictions within their region if deemed necessary to control the spread of the virus (e.g. partial lockdowns; limiting the capacity and opening hours of retail, hospitality establishments and public events, COVID passports). <br>
Local and regional restrictions may be introduced at short notice. You should <a href=""https://cnecovid.isciii.es/covid19/"">consult regional incidence levels</a>, refer to the advice of local authorities in your destination and ensure you are aware of the specific measures in place prior to travel.<br>
*Public spaces and services: Rules may vary between regions. You should refer to local and regional authorities for advice. You should continue to observe the following rules regardless of your whereabouts in Spain: <br>
•        obligatory use of face masks on public transport, in pharmacies, medical centres and care homes. <br>
•        abide by any safety measures put in place by establishments such as hotels, bars, shops and restaurants to reduce the risk of COVID-19 such as social distancing and other public safety precautions <br>
•        wash your hands frequently and thoroughly and use hand sanitizer gel where soap and water is not available <br>
Proof of vaccination: Spain will accept the COVID-19 vaccination record. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
Use of face masks: The use of face coverings is mandatory for anyone over the age of 6 years if you are in the following situations:<br>
•        on any form of public transport in Spain <br>
•        visiting a hospital or medical centre (including other healthcare settings such as dentists, opticians, pharmacies etc.) <br>
•        visiting a care or nursing home <br>
Face masks must cover the nose and mouth. <br>
In addition to the mandatory use of face masks in the above situations, the Spanish government recommends you use them responsibly in the following circumstances: <br>
•        enclosed public spaces such as shops, cinemas, bars and restaurants <br>
•        at large events (e.g. concerts, sporting events) <br>
•        when in the company of people considered clinically vulnerable or high-risk and social distancing of 1.5m cannot be observed <br>
•        at family gatherings <br>
•        in any other enclosed communal spaces open to the public <br>
Those with respiratory problems or those unable to wear a mask due to other health conditions or disabilities are exempt. More details are available from the <a href=""https://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2020/05/20/pdfs/BOE-A-2020-5142.pdf"">Ministry for Health  </a> (in Spanish). <br>
