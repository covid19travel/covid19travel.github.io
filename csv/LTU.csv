Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Facemasks: The Lithuanian Government lifted the majority of COVID-19 related restrictions on 1 May. Medical facemasks remain mandatory to visit patients in medical facilities. These rules do not apply to children under the age of six, or people with a medical exemption. If you cannot wear facemasks on medical grounds, you are advised to wear face shields if possible. Individual medical facilities have the right to apply requirements for other patients, staff, and visitors. <br>
The Lithuanian Government recommends that people should continue to wear facemasks in other indoor public places and on public transport, although it is no longer mandatory. <br>
*Public places and services: The Lithuanian Government no longer requires individuals to prove their vaccination status in order to access non-essential services. <br>
*COVID-19 tests in Lithuania: As a result of the end of COVID-19-related restrictions on 1 May, Lithuania is changing its COVID-19 management strategy. COVID-19 testing and vaccinations will be carried out in ordinary medical facilities; mobile points will be removed; testing will be limited to people with symptoms at the discretion of the GP; and the need for testing before hospitalisation will be decided by individual medical facilities. <br>
Individuals are no longer able to book COVID-19 tests directly themselves. This will be done by health providers at their discretion. <br>
If you are required to have a test for the purposes of travel, you will need to book your test through a private clinic. A list of private clinics offering PCR and antigen tests is available on the <a href=""https://nvsc.lrv.lt/en/information-on-covid-19/for-those-who-have-been-exposed-to-someone-with-covid-19/private-laboratories-for-testing-for-covid-19"">Lithuanian Ministry of Health website</a>
. The tests booked through these clinics will be charged. <br>
Not all testing centres in Lithuania offer results in English. If you require your results in English, you should request at the point of booking. English language result certificates are likely to incur additional charges. <br>
*Testing positive for COVID-19 in Lithuania: Self-isolation is no longer mandatory for individuals who test positive for COVID-19. If you have symptoms you are advised not to go to work, school or public places. <br>
