Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Facemasks: You must wear a medical facemask in all indoor public spaces in Lithuania, including shops, restaurants, businesses, workplaces, museums, theatres, public transport, taxis and educational environments. Masks should be three layers of non-woven material and bear the CE marking on their packaging. <br>
This does not apply to children under the age of six, or people with a medical exemption. If you cannot wear facemasks on medical grounds, you are advised to wear face shields if possible. Exemptions also apply to those doing physical exercise, providing a service that cannot be done with a facemask, or consuming food or drink. <br>
*Public places and services: A number of restrictions apply to those not vaccinated against COVID-19. Foreign nationals resident in Lithuania may be able to apply for the Lithuanian Freedom Pass, to prove their vaccination status. More information about registering for the pass is available on the <a href=""https://eimin.lrv.lt/en/important-information-for-business-on-coronavirus-3/national-certificate"">Lithuanian Ministry of the Economy and Innovation website</a>. The pass is designed to be used for public services in Lithuania, it is not considered valid proof of vaccination status for the purpose of international travel. <br>
From 1 December, the requirements for Freedom Passes for those aged 16 and over will change. To access the Freedom Pass/services previously available to those with a Freedom Pass, you will need to have proof of the following: <br>
Confirmation that you completed a full course of a COVID-19 vaccine approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) within the last seven months; or<br>
•        Confirmation that you have had an EMA approved COVID-19 vaccine booster within the last seven months; or<br>
•        A negative COVID-19 PCR test result, taken within the last 72 hours. PCR tests for individuals aged 16 and over, for the purpose of a Freedom Pass, will be charged. See COVID-19 tests in Lithuania; or<br>
•        Proof of recovery from COVID-19 in the last seven months.<br>
From 28 December, the requirement for a Freedom Pass or equivalent to access most non-essential public services in Lithuania will be extended to children from age 12 years and two months, but under 16. To access the Freedom Pass/services children of this age must have proof of one of the following:<br>
•        Confirmation that they had their first dose of EMA approved vaccine no earlier than two weeks and no later than 12 weeks before. Or, confirmation of a second dose of EMA approved COVID-19 vaccine at least one week before. COVID-19 vaccines are available to all children aged five years and older in Lithuania.

•        Proof of recovery from COVID-19, confirmed by a negative PCR test, in the last seven months<br>
Lithuania will accept proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record, if it meets the requirements set out above. If you are travelling with a printed PDF proof of vaccination status, it must date from 1 November to ensure that the certificate can be scanned successfully, if domestic certification is required. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.

*Testing positive for COVID-19 in Lithuania: If you test positive for COVID-19 with an antigen test, you should immediately register for a PCR test. Call the Lithuanian COVID-19 hotline on +370 37367 963 to request a COVID-19 PCR test. The hotline is open daily between 8am and 11pm. You must self-isolate until you receive your results and instructions from public health officials, even if you are asymptomatic. <br>
If you test positive for COVID-19 with a PCR test, you must self-isolate for 14 days. While in isolation, you must:<br>
•        not leave your place of isolation without the permission of a healthcare professional;<br>
•        not go to the shops;<br>
•        not attend face to face public services;<br>
•        not have guests/visitors;<br>
•        organise for essential provisions to be delivered by friends, family or delivery services;<br>
•        consult with a GP by phone/email to arrange extensions to prescriptions;<br>
•        call the Lithuanian COVID-19 hotline on +370 37367 963 if you display COVID-19 symptoms; and<br>
•        call the Emergency Response Centre on 112 if your symptoms become severe.<br>
The Lithuanian Government advises against self-isolating in properties with those who are not isolating. If this is not possible, you should stay in separate, well-ventilated rooms, restrict your movement within the home and minimise use of common spaces. Children who test positive for COVID-19 may isolate with a parent or guardian, but they must also adhere to self-isolation rules. You will be expected to cover the cost of your self-isolation accommodation, if you are unable to stay in a private property. <br>
While in isolation, you should expect to be contacted by Lithuanian health officials. They will ask you to provide: <br>
•        A list of individuals with whom you have been in close contact in the 14 days leading up to your first symptoms or to your day of testing, if you are asymptomatic. Close contacts are considered to be those people with whom you have been less than two metres apart for 15 minutes or more, without facemasks; and<br>
•        A list of locations that you have visited over the previous 14 days and the time of your visit.<br>
If you have a pet, but are unable to arrange alternative pet care, you may leave your place of isolation for up to 15 minutes at a time to walk your pet. This exception only applies to individuals who have no COVID-19 symptoms. British nationals needing to temporarily break isolation, who meet one of the <a href=""https://nvsc.lrv.lt/en/information-on-covid-19/for-arrivals-from-abroad/everything-you-need-to-know-about-isolation/when-are-you-allowed-to-leave-the-place-of-isolation"">requirements set out by the Lithuanian Government</a>, must <a href=""https://nvsc.lrv.lt/leave"">notify the NVSC in advance</a>. You do not need to inform the NVSC if you are breaking isolation for a COVID-19 PCR test or for emergency medical treatment. <br>
