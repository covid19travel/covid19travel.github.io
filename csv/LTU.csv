Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Facemasks: You must wear a medical facemask in all indoor public spaces in Lithuania, including shops, restaurants, businesses, workplaces, museums, theatres, public transport, taxis and educational environments. <br>
Masks should be three layers of non-woven material and bear the CE marking on their packaging. <br>
This does not apply to children under the age of six, or people with a medical exemption. If you cannot wear facemasks on medical grounds, you are advised to wear face shields if possible. Exemptions also apply to those doing physical exercise, providing a service that cannot be done with a facemask, or consuming food or drink. <br>
*Public places and services: A number of restrictions apply to those not vaccinated against COVID-19. Foreign residents in Lithuania may be able to apply for the Lithuanian Freedom Pass, to prove their vaccination status. More information about registering for the pass is available on the <a href=""https://eimin.lrv.lt/en/important-information-for-business-on-coronavirus-3/national-certificate"">Lithuanian Ministry of the Economy and Innovation website</a>. The pass is designed to be used for public services in Lithuania, it is not considered valid proof of vaccination status for the purpose of international travel. <br>
From 1 December, the requirements for Freedom Passes for those aged 16 and over will change. To access the Freedom Pass/services previously available to those with a Freedom Pass, you will need to have proof of the following: <br>
•        Confirmation that you completed a full course of a COVID-19 vaccine approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) within the last 7 months; or <br>
•        Confirmation that you have had an EMA approved COVID-19 vaccine booster within the last 7 months; or <br>
•        A negative COVID-19 PCR test result, taken within the last 72 hours. PCR tests for individuals aged 16 and over, for the purpose of a Freedom Pass, will be charged; or <br>
•        Proof of recovery from COVID-19 in the last 7 months.<br>
From 28 December, the requirement for a Freedom Pass or equivalent to access most non-essential public services in Lithuania will be extended to children aged 12 and over. Children aged over 12, but under 16, will be required to show: <br>
•        Confirmation that they completed a full course of EMA approved COVID-19 vaccine within the last 7 months. Full vaccination for children is considered to be two doses of vaccine; or <br>
•        A negative COVID-19 PCR test result, taken within the last 72 hours. Tests for children under 16 are available free of charge. <br>
•        Proof of recovery from COVID-19 in the last 7 months. <br>
Lithuania will request proof of vaccination. If you are travelling with a printed PDF proof of vaccination status, it must date from 1 November to ensure that the certificate can be scanned successfully, if domestic certification is required. <br>
