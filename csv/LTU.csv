Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Facemasks: You must wear a medical facemask in all indoor public spaces in Lithuania, including shops, restaurants, businesses, workplaces, museums, theatres, public transport, taxis and educational environments. <br>
Masks should be three layers of non-woven material and bear the CE marking on their packaging. <br>
This does not apply to children under the age of six, or people with a medical exemption. If you cannot wear facemasks on medical grounds, you are advised to wear face shields if possible. Exemptions also apply to those doing physical exercise, providing a service that cannot be done with a facemask, or consuming food or drink. <br>
*Public places and services: A number of restrictions apply to those not vaccinated against COVID-19. <br>
Foreign nationals resident in Lithuania may be able to apply for the Lithuanian Freedom Pass, to prove their vaccination status. More information about registering for the pass is available on the <a href=""https://eimin.lrv.lt/en/important-information-for-business-on-coronavirus-3/national-certificate"">Lithuanian Ministry of the Economy and Innovation website</a>. The pass is designed to be used for public services in Lithuania, it is not considered valid proof of vaccination status for the purpose of international travel. <br>
If you are aged 16 or over and do not have a Lithuanian Freedom Pass, you will need to have proof of one of the following in order to access the majority of non-essential services: <br>
•        Confirmation that you completed a full course of a COVID-19 vaccine approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) within the last seven months; or <br>
•        Confirmation that you have had an EMA approved COVID-19 vaccine booster within the last seven months; or <br>
•        A negative COVID-19 PCR test result, taken within the last 72 hours. PCR tests for individuals aged 16 and over, for the purpose of a Freedom Pass, will be charged. <br>
•        Proof of recovery from COVID-19 in the last seven months <br>
Children from the age of 12 years and two months, but under 16 must have proof of one of the following in order to access non-essential services: <br>
•        Confirmation that they had their first dose of EMA approved vaccine no earlier than two weeks and no later than 12 weeks before. Or, confirmation of a second dose of EMA approved COVID-19 vaccine at least one week before. COVID-19 vaccines are available to all children aged five years and older in Lithuania. <br>
•        A negative COVID-19 PCR test result, taken within the last seven days. Tests for children under 16 are available free of charge. <br>
•        Proof of recovery from COVID-19, confirmed by a negative PCR test, in the last seven months <br>
Lithuania will accept the proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record, if it meets the requirements set out above. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
