 Internal Restrictions: <br>
 COVID-19 restrictions: Restrictions on social contact aimed at reducing the spread of COVID-19 are in place in Germany, though gradually being reduced:<br>
• Private gatherings are restricted to one household plus another household up to a maximum of five people. Children under the age of 14 do not count towards the maximum of five. Tighter restrictions are in place in areas of high infection rates. Looser restrictions are in place where the incidence rate is below 35 in some states<br>
• The fully vaccinated and those who have recovered are exempt from the above restrictions on contact, as well as limits on contactless sport (these vary in the states). The fully vaccinated can demonstrate their status by using yellow vaccination booklets ‘Impfpass’ which contain a doctor’s signature and stamp. The recovered must show a positive PCR test no older than six months and no younger than 28 days. Germany is working on a C-19 certification app.<br>
• Employers are legally obliged to allow employees to work from home, where their work activities allow, with employees required to justify why they cannot work from home.<br>
• Depending on local incidence rates, there are restrictions on non-essential retail, gastronomy, barbers and hairdressers, museums, art galleries, and other cultural and leisure activities. These establishments might be closed completely, or you might need to register for an appointment in advance, or show C-19 certification, such as a test or vaccination status.<br>
• Medical grade masks are compulsory in shops and public transport, replacing a previous requirement for simple mouth-nose coverings. This may be an FFP-2 mask, rather than a simple surgical mask. You should follow local guidance. <br>
These restrictions are implemented by Germany’s 16 states. Where the seven–day incidence rate exceeds 100, restrictions may be tighter or be re-imposed with limited notice.<br>
