Proof of vaccination completed at least 14 days after receiving the full vaccination. Vaccines authorised by the Paul Ehrlich Institute are accepted: Pfizer-BioNtech, Moderna, Oxford-AstraZenica, Novavax, and Johnson & Johnson/Janssen (as of 15 January, in the case of Janssen/Johnson & Johnson a second dose of one of the specificed vaccines is required.

Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Public spaces and services: Medical grade masks, usually FFP-2 masks, are legally required on public transport and in health and social care settings. You should bring an FFP-2 mask with you to Germany. <br>
States are permitted to declare themselves or areas of their territory a hotspot and impose more stringent measures, such as mask-wearing in other settings or C-19 certification. States’ measures are available from the <a href=""https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/themen/coronavirus/corona-bundeslaender-1745198"">German government</a>. <br>
If travellers develop symptoms associated with COVID-19 (coughing, a runny nose, sore throat or fever) they should get in touch by phone with a doctor or contact the hotline 116 117. Often travel guides or hotels can also help in such cases. Guidance from the <a href=""https://www.zusammengegencorona.de/en/masking-up-ffp2-masks-to-protect-others-and-yourself/"">Federal Health Ministry</a> is available. <br>
*Testing positive for COVID-19 in Germany: Anyone testing positive with a Point of Care (PoC) antigen test is required to take a follow-up PCR test immediately and to self-isolate. Close contacts are also required to self-isolate, although exceptions may apply for those who are fully vaccinated. <br>
In the event of a positive PoC test, the test provider is required to notify the local health office (Gesundheitsamt), which is responsible for monitoring self-isolation and will provide further guidance in individual cases. You can find your local health office by postcode <a href=""https://tools.rki.de/plztool/"">here</a>. <br>
Individuals testing positive must self-isolate in their home or where they are staying locally, or in another appropriate location enabling self-isolation. They may only leave their home and interrupt self-isolation to carry out the PCR test. Germany does not operate a system of managed quarantine in government facilities. <br>
Mandatory self-isolation ceases after 5 days. The German authorities recommend staying in self-isolation until you test negative with a rapid-antigen test. <br>
