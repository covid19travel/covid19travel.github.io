Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Public spaces and services: Medical grade masks, usually FFP-2 masks, are legally required on public transport and in health and social care settings. You should bring an FFP-2 mask with you to Germany. <br>
States are permitted to declare themselves or areas of their territory a hotspot and impose more stringent measures, such as mask-wearing in other settings or C-19 certification. Statesâ€™ measures are available from the <a href=""https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/themen/coronavirus/corona-bundeslaender-1745198"">German government</a>.
If travellers develop symptoms associated with COVID-19 (coughing, a runny nose, sore throat or fever) they should get in touch by phone with a doctor or contact the hotline 116 117. Often travel guides or hotels can also help in such cases. <br>
Guidance from the <a href=""https://www.zusammengegencorona.de/en/masking-up-ffp2-masks-to-protect-others-and-yourself/"">Federal Health Ministry</a> is available.
Testing positive for COVID-19 in Germany: Anyone testing positive with a self-test is entitled to take a follow-up certified rapid antigen test or PCR test. Those testing positive with a certified rapid antigen test or PCR test are required to self-isolate. Mandatory self-isolation ceases after 5 days. The German authorities recommend staying in self-isolation until you test negative with a rapid-antigen test. The Federal Health Ministry provides <a href=""https://www.zusammengegencorona.de/en/when-do-i-have-to-quarantine-or-self-isolate/"">guidance on self-isolation</a>.
The local health office (Gesundheitsamt) is responsible for monitoring self-isolation and will provide further guidance in individual cases. You can <a href=""https://tools.rki.de/plztool/"">find your local health office by postcode</a>.
*If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
