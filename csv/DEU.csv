Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Public spaces and services: Both the vaccinated and unvaccinated must continue to adhere to basic non-pharmaceutical guidelines, such as social distancing, wearing masks in enclosed spaces, and regularly ventilating indoor spaces. Wearing a medical-grade mask remains a legal requirement in retail outlets and on public transport. Often an FFP-2 mask is required and you should make sure you have an FFP-2 mask with you. More guidance from the <a href=""https://www.zusammengegencorona.de/en/masking-up-ffp2-masks-to-protect-others-and-yourself/"">Federal Health Ministry</a> is available. <br>
German states often require C-19 certification, such asproof of vaccination, recovery from infection or a negative test (up to 24hrs old for rapid antigen testing or 48 hrs old for PCR testing) will be required for entry into: <br>
•        Hospitals and social care settings<br>
•        Indoor gastronomy<br>
•        Participating in events and celebrations<br>
•        Barbers, hairdressers, or beauty salons<br>
•        Indoor sport such as fitness studios, swimming baths or sports halls<br>
•        Hotels (test at arrival and twice a week during the stay)<br>
Children five years old and above are exempt from domestic testing requirements during term time. As school pupils are regularly tested at school, they only need to show their school pupil card to prove their C-19 status. The fully vaccinated can demonstrate their status using Germany’s two C-19 certification apps (the CovPass-App or the Corona-Warn-App; see below)or the UK COVID Pass. Other vaccination certification is accepted for domestic purposes in electronic form as long as it has:<br>
•        The date of vaccination;<br>
•        Name and batch name of the vaccine;<br>
•        Name of the disease against which vaccination was given;<br>
•        Name of the person vaccinated, their date of birth and the name and address of the person responsible for administering the vaccination, and;<br>
•        Confirmation in writing or in electronic form with a qualified electronic signature or a qualified electronic seal by the person responsible for administering the vaccination.<br>
Germany will accept proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered at least 14 days prior to travel. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
Those who have recently recovered from Covid must show a positive PCR test at least 28 days old but no older than six months. As rules may vary please check the latest <a href=""https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/themen/coronavirus/corona-bundeslaender-1745198"">local guidance</a> (in German). There are a variety of sources in English including <a href=""https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/themen/buerokratieabbau/nina-lokale-corona-hinweise-1827552"">Germany’s NINA Warn App</a>
<br>
*Testing positive for COVID-19 in Germany: Anyone testing positive with a Point of Care (PoC) antigen test is required to take a follow-up PCR test immediately and to self-isolate. Close contacts are also required to self-isolate, although exceptions may apply for those who are fully vaccinated. <br>
In the event of a positive PoC test, the test provider is required to notify the local health office (Gesundheitsamt), which is responsible for monitoring self-isolation and will provide further guidance in individual cases. You can find your local health office by postcode <a href=""https://tools.rki.de/plztool/"">here</a>. <br>
Individuals testing positive must self-isolate in their home or where they are staying locally, or in another appropriate location enabling self-isolation. They may only leave their home and interrupt self-isolation to carry out the PCR test. Germany does not operate a system of managed quarantine in government facilities. <br>
Mandatory self-isolation ceases in the event of a negative PCR test. Otherwise self-isolation lasts for 14 days, or until the local health office confirms release.
