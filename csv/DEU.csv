Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Public spaces and services: Medical grade masks, usually FFP-2 masks, are still legally required in health and social care settings. Public transport may still have signs indicating mandatory mask wearing but these are no longer valid. <br>
If travellers develop symptoms associated with COVID-19 (coughing, a runny nose, sore throat or fever) they should get in touch by phone with a doctor or contact the hotline 116 117. Often travel guides or hotels can also help in such cases. <br>
Guidance from the <a href=""https://www.zusammengegencorona.de/en/masking-up-ffp2-masks-to-protect-others-and-yourself/"">Federal Health Ministry</a> is available.<br>
*If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there
