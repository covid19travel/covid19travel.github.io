Internal Restrictions: <br>
*What to do if you test positive while in Greece: If you test positive for COVID-19 while in Greece you must self-isolate for 5 days from the date of the positive test result. You may leave self-isolation after 5 days if you are no longer experiencing symptoms, otherwise you should continue to self-isolate. <br>
If you have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive and have received your booster, you are not obliged to self-isolate but must take a PCR or rapid test on day 5 of the exposure. If you are unvaccinated or are vaccinated but have not received your booster, you must take a PCR or rapid test and self-isolate for 5 days. <br>
The above guidance may not apply in the case of variants of special interest. These cases will be assessed by the EMEA (Greek health authority) and appropriate instructions will be given. <br>
Depending on the circumstances, you may be able to self-isolate in your current accommodation, or Greek authorities will ask you to self-isolate in a state provided quarantine hotel. The expense of the accommodation in quarantine hotels is covered by the Greek state. Local authorities will be able to offer further advice on self-isolation requirements. <br>
If you do not self-isolate or quarantine when required you may be fined by the Hellenic Police. The fine could be as much as €5000. You should comply with any requirement to self-isolate or quarantine. <br>
Plan ahead and make sure you:<br>
•        can access money<br>
•        understand what your insurance will cover<br>
•        can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned<br>
*Quarantine hotels: If you test positive for COVID-19 you may have to enter a quarantine hotel. In Greece, the Greek authorities will pay the cost of your quarantine.<br>
EHIC or GHIC cards can not be used to cover any additional expenses you incur whilst staying in a quarantine hotel. Make sure you have access to funds to cover the costs or take out insurance, checking the policy has adequate cover.<br>
*Wearing a mask: It is mandatory to wear a mask in all indoor public spaces, in all areas of Greece. In certain areas, such as in supermarkets and pharmacies, and on public transport, you will be required to wear either double masks (at least one of which should be surgical), or an N95/FFP2 mask. <br>
*Public spaces and services: All restrictions remain under regular review. In Regional Units (περιφερειακές ενότητες) where the spread of COVID-19 is particularly high and hospital capacity is limited, restrictions may be tighter or re-imposed with limited notice. Check the latest local guidance and follow the advice of local authorities. <br>
Only the most relevant measures to travellers are included below. You should keep up-to-date by checking this page regularly, and following local announcements. <br>
As restrictions may vary, you should <a href=""https://covid19.gov.gr/covid-map-en/"">check the latest local guidance</a>. <br>
•        Until 1 May, proof of vaccination is required to enter public spaces such as shops, restaurants (indoor and outdoor) and museums. You should be prepared to demonstrate your proof of vaccination and present ID (passport or Greek Residence card) when asked. If you are not fully vaccinated (including children), see Unvaccinated in Greece. From 1 May, this requirement will be lifted.<br>
•        You must use a facemask in all indoor public and communal spaces. In certain areas, such as in supermarkets and pharmacies, and on public transport, you will be required to wear either double masks (at least one of which should be surgical), or an N95/FFP2 mask.<br>
•        Unless all passengers are members of the same family, a maximum of 3 persons are permitted to travel in a taxi or other private vehicle with up to 7 seats, or 4 persons in a private vehicle with up to 9 seats.<br>
*Demonstrating your COVID-19 status: Greece will accept proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. It will also accept proof of COVID-19 vaccination. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered at least 14 days prior to you presenting your evidence of vaccination (this does not apply to boosters, which are valid straight away). Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. COVID-19 recovery certificates are valid for 180 days from the 14th day after the date of the first positive test result.<br>
If you are 18 years old or over and more than 9 months have elapsed since you completed your initial vaccination course against COVID-19, Greece considers your vaccination status expired unless you have received a booster vaccine.<br>
*Travel in Greece: Travel within Greece between Regional Units is permitted subject to adherence to public health measures as outlined above. You must wear either double masks (at least one of which should be surgical) or an N95/FFP2 mask at all times on all public transport.<br>
If you are travelling by internal (domestic) flights, specific measures relating to check-in, baggage allowances and other details may be in place to reduce the spread of coronavirus. You should check with your operator directly for further detail.<br>
*Accommodation: All hotels are permitted to open, and other types of accommodation, including e.g. Airbnb, private rentals and hostels, are also available. However, you should note that many operators are likely to reduce their offer and close some accommodation during the winter months, particularly in light of measures put in place by the Greek authorities to fight the spread of COVID-19. You should check directly with your accommodation provider in case of related concerns.<br>
