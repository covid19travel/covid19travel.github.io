Internal Restrictions: <br>
*What to do if you test positive while in Greece: If you test positive for COVID-19 while in Greece you must self-isolate for 5 days from the date of the positive test result. You may leave self-isolation after 5 days if you are no longer experiencing symptoms, otherwise you should continue to self-isolate. <br>
If you have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive and have received your booster, you are not obliged to self-isolate but must take a PCR or rapid test on day 5 of the exposure. If you are unvaccinated or are vaccinated but have not received your booster, you must take a PCR or rapid test and self-isolate for 5 days. <br>
The above guidance may not apply in the case of variants of special interest. These cases will be assessed by the EMEA (Greek health authority) and appropriate instructions will be given. Depending on the circumstances, you may be able to self-isolate in your current accommodation, or Greek authorities will ask you to self-isolate in a state provided quarantine hotel. The expense of the accommodation in quarantine hotels is covered by the Greek state. Local authorities will be able to offer further advice on self-isolation requirements. <br>
If you do not self-isolate or quarantine when required you may be fined by the Hellenic Police. The fine could be as much as €5000. You should comply with any requirement to self-isolate or quarantine. <br>
Plan ahead and make sure you:<br>
•        can access money<br>
•        understand what your insurance will cover<br>
•        can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned<br>
*Quarantine hotels: If you test positive for COVID-19 you may have to enter a quarantine hotel. In Greece, the Greek authorities will pay the cost of your quarantine. <br>
EHIC or GHIC cards can not be used to cover any additional expenses you incur whilst staying in a quarantine hotel. Make sure you have access to funds to cover the costs or take out insurance, checking the policy has adequate cover. If you have or are entitled to an EHIC or GHIC and you need medical treatment while staying at a quarantine hotel.<br>
*Wearing a mask: The Greek government has announced that, from 6am on Friday 24 December, it will be mandatory to wear masks (either double surgical masks or N95 masks) in all indoor and outdoor public spaces, in all areas of Greece. <br>
*Public spaces and services: All restrictions remain under regular review. In Regional Units (περιφερειακές ενότητες) where the spread of COVID-19 is particularly high and hospital capacity is limited, restrictions may be tighter or re-imposed with limited notice. Check the latest local guidance and follow the advice of local authorities. Only the most relevant measures to travellers are included below. You should keep up-to-date by checking this page regularly, and following local announcements. As restrictions may vary, you should <a href=""https://covid19.gov.gr/covid-map-en/"">check the latest local guidance</a>. <br>
•        Proof of vaccination is required to enter public spaces such as shops, restaurants (indoor and outdoor) and museums. You should be prepared to demonstrate your proof of vaccination and present ID (passport or Greek Residence card) when asked. If you are not fully vaccinated (including children), see Unvaccinated in Greece;<br>
•        You must use a facemask (double surgical mask or N65 mask) in all indoor and outdoor public and communal spaces, including work-places and on public transport;<br>

*Demonstrating your COVID-19 status:  Greece will accept proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. It will also accept proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered at least 14 days prior to you presenting your evidence of vaccination. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
*Unvaccinated in Greece: If you have not been fully vaccinated or do not have proof of recovery from COVID-19:<br>
•        Travel by aeroplane, train and bus is allowed subject to either a certified negative PCR test in the last 72 hours before the scheduled time of arrival at destination, or to a certified rapid (antigen) test within 48 hours of scheduled arrival at destination;<br>
•        You will not be allowed to enter nightclubs, restaurants (indoors), theatres, cinemas, museums, exhibitions, conferences, gyms and stadiums;<br>
•        You must present proof of a negative rapid test, taken up to 48 hours before entry, to visit other public spaces including shops and restaurants (outdoors);<br>

•        Unvaccinated children (between the ages 4 and 18) require a negative self-test to enter public spaces such as shops, restaurants (indoor and outdoor) and museums<br>
From 13 December 2021, if you are 60 years old or over and more than 7 months have passed since your second vaccination dose and you have not received a third dose, Greece considers your vaccination status expired. This does not affect entry to Greece (see Entry requirements), but domestic ‘unvaccinated’ measures will apply within Greece.<br>
*Travel in Greece: Travel within Greece between Regional Units is permitted subject to adherence to public health measures as outlined above. You must wear a mask at all times on all public transport. Cross-regional travel is allowed for mainland Greece and the islands of Lefkada, Evia and Salamina (use of self-tests ahead of travel is strongly recommended but is not mandatory). Cross-regional travel by air and sea to the rest of Greece is permitted for those aged 12 and above but only with either:<br>
•        proof of vaccination and 14 days since second dose; or<br>
•        a negative result from a PCR test carried out up to 72 hours prior to travel; or<br>
•        a negative result from a certified rapid test up to 48 hours before travel; or<br>
Children aged 5 to 11, can travel with a negative self-test taken up to 24 hours before the scheduled travel time.<br>
If you are travelling by internal (domestic) flights, specific measures relating to check-in, baggage allowances and other details are in place to reduce the spread of coronavirus. You should check with your operator directly for further detail.<br>
*Accommodation: All hotels are permitted to open, and other types of accommodation, including e.g. Airbnb, private rentals and hostels, are also available. However, you should note that many operators are likely to reduce their offer and close some accommodation during the winter months, particularly in light of measures put in place by the Greek authorities to fight the spread of COVID-19. You should check directly with your accommodation provider in case of related concerns.
