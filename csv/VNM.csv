Quarantine is mandatory for anyone coming to Vietnam or who may have come in to contact with coronavirus inside. Vietnamese government quarantine centres are basic. Most do not meet Public Health England standards.

This is not guaranteed, is time consuming and must be arranged by your employer in Vietnam before you enter Vietnam. The Vietnamese government has confirmed that anyone entering Vietnam from 1 September 2020 must pay for quarantine costs both in government centres and in designated hotels. You will also be responsible for paying for any coronavirus hospital treatment costs.<br>
You should expect to go into quarantine for at least 14 days. Fully vaccinated visitors may be permitted to leave after 7 days with a further 7 days at a place of residence. Quarantine will be longer if you test positive at any point. If you test positive, you should expect to be treated in a Vietnamese hospital. Asymptomatic patients may be discharged from hospital after 10 days and have 2 back to back negative COVID-19 tests. Once discharged you will be expected to undertake a period of self-isolation for 14 days and should follow the instructions issued by the local authorities. You should expect to be tested at least 3 times prior to release, and will be required to produce at least 2 consecutive negative tests during quarantine and may require further negative tests during self-isolation. Once you have completed quarantine and self-isolation you should receive a document specifying this. You should keep this, as you may need to present it customs/airport officials when you leave Vietnam.","Fully vaccinated visitors to Vietnam with negative COVID-19 test results may be permitted to shorten their period of quarantine on entry at an assigned facility to 7 days, followed by another 7 days of medical surveillance at their residence.<br>","Latest News: Authorities ban Cathay Pacific flights from Ho Chi Minh City Airport for two weeks after three passengers on flight test positive for COVID-19 (Vn Express, 13.12.2021).
