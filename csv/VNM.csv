 <br>
 <br>
 International Restrictions:<br>
*Entry to Vietnam: Vietnam has suspended visa waivers, issuing of visas, and the entry into Vietnam for most foreign nationals, regardless of vaccination status. There are a very small number of exceptions for diplomats on official business and certain high-skilled workers and for foreigners and overseas visitors holding valid permanent or temporary residence cards, visas and visa exemption certificates. These people do not need to obtain prior approval from ministries and local authorities before entering. <br>
Those wishing to enter for tourism may only do so by joining one of the tour groups operating tours to destinations approved by the Ministry of Culture, Sports & Tourism. <br>
All other visitors wishing to enter will be processed on a case-by-case basis. Such applications are required to be led by Vietnamese employers who must work directly through individual provincial government offices. The requirements and process may differ from province to province. If you are permitted to travel to Vietnam, you must follow the testing and quarantine requirements outlined below.
*If you’re fully vaccinated: If you are permitted to enter Vietnam and are fully vaccinated (at least two doses of a vaccine recognised and approved by Vietnam) you must comply with the following testing and quarantine requirements.

Your final vaccine dose must have been administered more than 14 days prior to travel, and no more than 12 months from the day of entry. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>

*If you’re transiting through Vietnam: Currently transiting through Vietnam is not allowed. <br>
*Exemptions: Vietnam has suspended visa waivers, issuing of visas, and the entry into Vietnam for all foreign nationals. There are a very small number of exceptions for diplomats on official business and certain high-skilled workers and for foreigners and overseas visitors holding valid permanent or temporary residence cards, visas and visa exemption certificates.

*Visas: If you want to stay in Vietnam, you should only do so legally and with the right visa and permission to stay. Immigration offices may close or travel to them may not be possible due to local COVID-19 measures. You should check before travelling whether the immigration offices where you are remain open and working normally. <br>
Those needing to renew their visas can do so by completing the support request form at <a href=""https://xuatnhapcanh.gov.vn/"">https://xuatnhapcanh.gov.vn/ </a>or by telephoning the following number: 0283 920 0365 (ideally with the help of a Vietnamese speaker). Following the resumption of some commercial international commercial flights, from 15 January 2022 those who entered Vietnam on visa waivers, e-visas or tourist visas from 1 March 2020 will no longer be entitled to an automatic visa extension. <br>
If you now plan to leave Vietnam permanently and entered before 1 March 2020 without undergoing mandatory quarantine or treatment for COVID-19, you should contact your local immigration office in order to apply for your exit visa and pay any overstay fees. Going to the airport without an exit visa will result in you being denied boarding for your flight. <br>
Vietnamese visit visas are issued to foreign nationals for a limited duration and on the basis that visitors must leave on or before the date of expiry. Those who come to Vietnam to work are required to apply for a work visa / permit. You should check the visa validity and conditions carefully. Overstaying your Vietnamese visit visa or working illegally is a serious matter and you may be delayed from travel until a fine is paid, deported and may be prevented from visiting Vietnam in the future. <br>
The Embassy and Consulate General will not be able to assist with individual visit visa extensions should you wish to stay in Vietnam, nor sponsor individual applications or sign NA5 forms (which has the same effect) as this involves legal and financial obligations. For those with a valid work visa or resident cards, you can extend these at immigration offices with the assistance and support of your family or employer.<br>

Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Public spaces and services: The measures to combat COVID-19 vary from province to province and can change at short notice. Vietnam has introduced a colour-coded categorisation to identify high risk COVID areas across Vietnam. These categories can vary between provinces and within cities. The categories are: Red (very high risk), Orange (high risk), Yellow (medium risk) and Green (normal). The Vietnamese authorities regularly review the categorisations. Restrictions will differ depending on the categorisation of particular districts within cities. You should be ready to comply with local authorities. <br>
You should also ensure that you have your ID/passport with you. Before travelling to another province you should check with your travel provider and/or accommodation what requirements are in place, both where you are travelling to and on return. Some provinces may require negative COVID-19 tests to be obtained before and/or after entry and some may impose periods of self-isolation. Social distancing rules remain in place in many places across Vietnam and you should follow these strictly. Mask wearing is compulsory in public settings. Those not wearing masks may be liable to spot fines. <br>
*Hanoi: Restrictions within Hanoi can vary between districts depending on colour-coded categorisations designated by the local authorities. The Hanoi local authorities review these categorisations weekly. You should be alert to changes and be ready to comply with restrictions put in place. <br>
Ho Chi Minh City: You should install on your phone the PC-Covid App and register your travel. You should also carry other proof of your vaccinations. There may be local variations so you should talk to your landlord or local ward authorities or resident group (tổ dân phố) for details as to what restrictions are in place in your area. <br>
Residents should ensure they have their medical declaration QR code with them at all times. If you experience COVID-19 symptoms you should report to your local Ward Response Team or call 115
*If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
