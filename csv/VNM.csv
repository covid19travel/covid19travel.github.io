 International Restrictions:<br>
After the government approved a two-week first phase in resumption of flights to nine destinations starting January 1, the CAAV has granted flight slots for domestic carriers to eight of them: Bangkok, San Francisco, Seoul, Singapore, Taipei, Tokyo, Phnom Penh and Vientiane (VnExpress, 04.01.2022).<br>
Commercial flights to and from Vietnam remain limited, but from 1 January 2022 Vietnam has resumed some international commercial flights on selected routes. A number of airline websites allow online booking from Vietnam. However, check carefully in advance whether these flights are guaranteed to fly, whether they are passenger flights and whether you are able to book the return journey to Vietnam. 
Flights and transit arrangements are still prone to changes and cancellation with little notice. You should check with your travel agent or airline before travelling for any last minute change and/or additional travel requirements. There are some restrictions on airside transit at airports you may transit when travelling to and from Vietnam. You should check in advance to ensure you will be able to transit, particularly transit times, visa and transit visa requirements and whether your baggage can be transferred airside at transit points.<br>
*Entry to Vietnam: When arriving in Vietnam from overseas you must complete a health declaration and provide evidence of a negative COVID-19 PCR test taken up to 72 hours before arrival. You will have to take a quick (e.g. lateral flow) COVID test on arrival at Hanoi International Airport (Noi Bai) and HCMC International Airport (Tan Son Nhat). If you test positive you will be taken to a centralised quarantine facility for a confirmatory PCR test. If you test positive you can expect to spend several days in the centralised quarantine facility. <br>

If you are not fully vaccinated or are travelling with unvaccinated children you must self-isolate for 7 days and have tests on days 3 and 7 and then self-monitor for 14 days. <br>
These rules are liable to change. Check with local authorities / your travel operator before you travel. Some airlines are also instructing passengers to have a quick COVID test within 24 hours of their flight and there may be additional requirements for transiting passengers. <br>
Vietnam has suspended visa waivers, issuing of visas and the entry into Vietnam for all foreign nationals. There are a very small number of exceptions for diplomats on official business and certain high-skilled workers. These will be processed on a case by case basis. Such applications are required to be led by Vietnamese employers who must work directly through individual provincial government offices. The requirements and process may differ from province to province. The costs of quarantine, both in government centres and designated hotels, must be paid by those arriving or their employers. <br>
*Demonstrating your COVID-19 status: Fully vaccinated visitors to Vietnam with negative COVID-19 test results may be permitted to shorten their period of quarantine on entry at an assigned facility to 7 days, followed by another 7 days of medical surveillance at their residence. <br>
For those who have permission to travel, Vietnam will accept proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered at least 14 days prior to travel, and no more than 12 months from the day of entry. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. For further information on entry requirements for those visiting Vietnam, visit the Vietnam Embassy website. <br>
*Land borders: Borders with China, Cambodia and Laos are currently closed except for the import and export of goods and returning Vietnamese nationals. <br>
*Transiting Vietnam: Currently transit in Vietnam is not allowed. <br>
*Data collection: Those arriving in Vietnam are required to provide information about recent travel. <br>
*Testing on departure: There is no requirement for testing on departure though anyone who has tested positive previously may be asked to show their negative test results and release certificates and airlines may require a negative test certificate to board. <br>
*Quarantine requirements on arrival: Quarantine is mandatory for anyone coming to Vietnam or who may have come in to contact with coronavirus inside. There are provisions for people who are exceptionally allowed to enter the country for work to be allowed to undertake quarantine in a hotel approved by the Ministry of Health. This is not guaranteed, is time consuming and must be arranged by your employer in Vietnam before you enter Vietnam. <br>
The Vietnamese government has confirmed that anyone entering Vietnam from 1 September 2020 must pay for quarantine costs both in government centres and in designated hotels. You will also be responsible for paying for any coronavirus hospital treatment costs. <br>
Vietnam’s quarantine requirements are mandated by the Vietnamese Ministry of Health. The British Embassy and Consulate General are unable to intervene in having these requirements waived, shortened or changed or assist in the reservation of, or transfer to, hotels used for quarantine. Violations carry strict penalties. <br>
You should expect to go into quarantine for at least 14 days. Fully vaccinated visitors may be permitted to leave after 7 days with a further 7 days at a place of residence. Quarantine will be longer if you test positive at any point. If you test positive, you should expect to be treated in a Vietnamese hospital. Asymptomatic patients may be discharged from hospital after 10 days and have 2 back to back negative COVID-19 tests. Once discharged you will be expected to undertake a period of self-isolation for 14 days and should follow the instructions issued by the local authorities. You should expect to be tested at least 3 times prior to release, and will be required to produce at least 2 consecutive negative tests during quarantine and may require further negative tests during self-isolation. <br>
Once you have completed quarantine and self-isolation you should receive a document specifying this. You should keep this, as you may need to present it customs/airport officials when you leave Vietnam.
