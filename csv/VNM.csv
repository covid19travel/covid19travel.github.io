 International Restrictions:<br>
*Entry to Vietnam: Vietnam has suspended visa waivers, issuing of visas and the entry into Vietnam for all foreign nationals. There are a very small number of exceptions for diplomats on official business and certain high-skilled workers. These will be processed on a case by case basis. Such applications are required to be led by Vietnamese employers who must work directly through individual provincial government offices. The requirements and process may differ from province to province. The costs of quarantine, both in government centres and designated hotels, must be paid by those arriving or their employers. <br>
*Demonstrating your COVID-19 status: Fully vaccinated visitors to Vietnam with negative COVID-19 test results may be permitted to shorten their period of quarantine on entry at an assigned facility to 7 days, followed by another 7 days of medical surveillance at their residence. <br>
Vietnam will accept the proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record for those who have permission to travel to Vietnam. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
*Land borders: Borders with China, Cambodia and Laos are currently closed except for the import and export of goods and returning Vietnamese nationals. <br>
*Transiting Vietnam: Currently transit in Vietnam is not allowed.<br>
*Data collection: Those arriving in Vietnam are required to provide information about recent travel. <br>
*Testing on departure: There is no requirement for testing on departure though anyone who has tested positive previously may be asked to show their negative test results and release certificates. <br>
*Quarantine requirements: Quarantine is mandatory for anyone who may have come in to contact with coronavirus inside Vietnam and for most coming to Vietnam Vietnamese government quarantine centres are basic. There are provisions for people who are exceptionally allowed to enter the country for work to be allowed to undertake quarantine in a hotel approved by the Ministry of Health. This is not guaranteed, is time consuming and must be arranged by your employer in Vietnam before you enter Vietnam. <br>
The Vietnamese government has confirmed that anyone entering Vietnam from 1 September 2020 must pay for quarantine costs both in government centres and in designated hotels. You will also be responsible for paying for any coronavirus hospital treatment costs. Vietnam’s quarantine requirements are mandated by the Vietnamese Ministry of Health. Violations carry strict penalties. <br>
You should expect to go into quarantine for at least 14 days. Fully vaccinated visitors may be permitted to leave after 7 days with a further 7 days at a place of residence. Quarantine will be longer if you test positive at any point. If you test positive, you will be treated in a Vietnamese hospital. Asymptomatic patients may be discharged from hospital after 10 days and have 2 back to back negative COVID-19 tests. Once discharged you will be expected to undertake a period of self-isolation for 14 days and should follow the instructions issued by the local authorities. You should expect to be tested at least 3 times prior to release, and will be required to produce at least 2 consecutive negative tests during quarantine and may require further negative tests during self-isolation. Quarantine periods and testing requirements may change at short notice and may vary between locations. <br>
Once you have completed quarantine and self-isolation you should receive a document specifying this. You should keep this, as you may need to present it customs/airport officials when you leave Vietnam. <br>
Vietnam uses community testing as a means to provide assurance that COVID-19 is not being transmitted undetected. Should you be asked to undertake testing, you should comply. Failure to comply can be an offence with significant punishments.
