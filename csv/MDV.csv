Even with an approved recovery certificate, you still need to take a PCR test no more than 96 hours before your departure. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
*Data collection: All visitors to Maldives are encouraged to install the contact tracing application ‘Trace Ekee’ upon or before arrival into the country. <br>
*Testing on departure: Testing services are available in the Maldives for tourists who need COVID-19 test results to return to their countries of origin or another destination.<br>
  <br>
  <br> 
Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Travel in Maldives: Those who have received two vaccination doses and have a negative PCR test result can travel internally to islands that are not under monitoring without having to quarantine. If the positivity rate is between 5 and 10% on the island you are travelling from, you must observe a 7 day quarantine at your destination island. If the positivity rate is higher than 10%, 14 day quarantine must be observed at destination. Use of masks is mandatory while travelling by air and sea. <br>
Those who have not received two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine can only travel to inhabited islands with guesthouses if: <br>
•        60% of the island population have completed two doses of a WHO-approved COVID-19 vaccine; <br>
•        95% of all employees in the tourism sector of the island have completed two doses of a WHO-approved COVID-19 vaccine; <br>
•        90% of the island population over the age of 60 has completed two doses of a WHO-approved COVID-19 vaccine; <br>
You will be regarded as having completed two doses only after 14 days have passed since you received your second dose of a WHO-approved COVID-19 vaccine. <br>
Unvaccinated visitors that travel to islands that meet the above vaccine coverage criteria must take a PCR test 7 days after arrival. As the Greater Male’ area does not meet the criteria specified above, only tourists who have completed two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine can stay at hotels and guesthouses in the area. <br>
Tourists can travel between islands and resorts that do not have COVID-19 cases and are not subject to monitoring for COVID-19, but need prior approval for inter-island travel from <a href=""splitstays@tourism.gov.mv"">splitstays@tourism.gov.mv</a>. If you have stayed at a tourist guesthouse (as opposed to a resort island) at any point during your stay in Maldives, you need to conduct a PCR test 72 hours prior to your scheduled departure from Maldives. <br>
*Accommodation: Some resorts are open to tourists. <br>
Guesthouses and city hotels are open for tourists. <br>
*Public places and services: Social distancing measures are in place. Public and mass gatherings of up to 30 people are now allowed throughout the Greater Male’ region, including parties and rallies. A distance of three feet must be maintained with others when going out. Use of masks is mandatory on all inhabited islands when going out in public. <br>
Public spaces such as parks or sports grounds in the Greater Male’ area are open with three feet social distancing measures to be observed and mandatory use of masks except when exercising. 
*If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
