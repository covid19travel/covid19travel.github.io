International Restrictions:<br>
*Entry to St Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha:  All air arrivals (except from Ascension) to St Helena are required to have had a negative COVID-19 test within 72 hours before travelling to the island. They are also subject to compulsory quarantine for 14 days and will be tested on arrival and at the end of quarantine. The only exception are individuals travelling from Ascension who have been resident for 14 days or more prior to travel. <br>
There are no other entry restrictions in force and foreign nationals are permitted to enter St Helena provided they meet the immigration rules. <br>
All travellers to Ascension Island require an entry permit visa unless exempted by their occupation, such as active members of UK Armed Forces. Failure to enter with a valid visa is an offence under the Entry Control (Ascension) Ordinance and may result in a fine and imprisonment. Individuals may also be refused permission to land and be required to leave on the aircraft or vessel that they arrived on. Applicants should be aware that their applications may be affected by a change in the Ascension COVID-19 Response Level, particularly if this reflects an escalation of the seriousness of the COVID-19 threat on the island. During such circumstances permissions for certain types of entry permits may not be granted, and extant permissions may be revoked. <br>
All arrivals to Ascension that have travelled from a COVID-19 infected area within the last 14 days, or travelled with others who have been in an infected area in the last 14 days, are subject to isolation restrictions for 14 days following their arrival at Ascension unless otherwise directed by the Senior Medical Officer. During this time their conditions are monitored for the development of symptoms which may be considered consistent with COVID-19. Air crews are also required to isolate for the duration of their stay on island. The Ascension Island Government will test all arrivals for COVID-19 before they exit quarantine. <br>
Countries currently defined as being an infected area are listed <a href=""https://www.ascension.gov.ac/public-document/cv01n-notice-of-infected-areas-18-august-2020"">here</a>. <br>
During compulsory isolation, you will not be allowed to leave your accommodation unless directed to by local authorities or unless in an emergency. You will receive a daily welfare check from the local police detachment. <br>
All visitors to Tristan da Cunha require the authority of the Island Council in advance. Visitors to Tristan are currently restricted to returning Tristanians and expatriates on contract to the Government of Tristan da Cunha. Tristan da Cunha has banned all visits by cruise liners and yachts. The only boats going to Tristan da Cunha are the supply vessels from Cape Town which undergo strict quarantine/sanitisation procedures before leaving Cape Town. These vessels only run 8 times per year. <br>
*Transiting South Africa en route to St Helena / Ascension / Tristan da Cunha: See entry to South Africa. For more information on visas, contact the nearest South African Embassy. <br>
*Testing/Screening on Arrival:  All arrivals to St Helena (except individuals from Ascension who have spent 14 days or more on the island prior to their flight) will be subject to compulsory quarantine for 14 days and will require a test at the beginning and end of quarantine to check they are free of COVID-19. For those arriving by ship/yacht time at sea will count towards the 14 days quarantine period. <br>
All arrivals to Ascension may be subject to testing at their port of entry. If you feel unwell or develop COVID-19 symptoms during your journey, you should make the crew aware and they will ensure containment measures are implemented on arrival.

Internal Restrictions:<br>
*Travel in St Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha: There is currently a travel corridor between St Helena and Ascension. Individuals who have been resident on St Helena or Ascension for 14 days or more prior to their flight will be able to travel between the two islands without the requirement for quarantine. On Ascension, medical clearance by the Senior Medical Officer is required on arrival before quarantine is exempted. In St Helena, those arriving by air (except travellers from Ascension) must quarantine in a property deemed by the authorities to be appropriate for quarantine or they will be taken to a government quarantine facility where they will spend 14 days. They will be tested for COVID-19 on arrival and again after 14 days. Any breach of quarantine may result in a fine of up to £5,000. There is no requirement for face coverings and there are no social distancing measures in force. Once new arrivals have completed quarantine, and tested negative for COVID-19, there are no local restrictions on travel within St Helena. Visitors can use taxis, public transport or rental cars to explore the island. Given its extreme isolation and lack of visitors, there is currently no social distancing on Tristan da Cunha. On Ascension you must wear a face covering from your port of arrival until you reach your isolation accommodation. Ascension’s Public Health (Coronavirus) (Temporary Measures) Regulations 2020, enables local authorities to enforce public health measures. The penalties for breaches of these Regulations consist of a fine of up to £5,000 and up to six months in prison. <br>
*Accommodation: Hotels and other accommodation are open on St Helena. On Tristan, the only accommodation is government guest houses, which have to be arranged via the Tristan da Cunha Tourism Department well ahead of any proposed visit.
On Ascension, all accommodation available to rent privately remains open as usual and is suitable for use during any period of compulsory isolation. <br>
*Public spaces and services: Public places and services are open as usual and there are no restrictions on large gatherings. However, should Covid-19 present itself on any of the Islands, the authorities have the power to close public places and limit public gatherings.
