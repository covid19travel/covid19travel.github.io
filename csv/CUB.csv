 Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Travel in Cuba: On 19 July 2022, the Government made face masks “mandatory” again on public transport and in healthcare settings and medical facilities, as well as for people with respiratory symptoms. Using face masks in all other settings is “recommended”. <br>
Visitors are allowed to hire cars but should check with the hire companies if they are open and have cars available, and where you can drive to under current COVID-19 measures, before making plans. <br>
Check with your tour operator and seek local advice if you have questions about excursions to other parts of Cuba, including whether car hire is allowed. <br>
*Accommodation: Hotels and guest houses are open. Guests may have to wear face masks in some hotel areas and facilities. <br>
Campsites are also open.: Medical teams in hotels will check on health of guests, including taking their temperature, and will be available to guests who feel unwell in between those visits. Local medical representatives will visit campsites and “casas particulares” (private guest house). Anyone with respiratory symptoms may be moved to a clinic or isolation centre and will have to pay for PCR test(s) and medical services by credit card. Any travelling companion may be required to self-isolate in their accommodation pending a negative PCR test result, or be tested themselves. <br>
Hotels may limit the numbers of people using facilities at any one time, especially swimming pools (if open) and elevators.
