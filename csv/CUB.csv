 Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Travel in Cuba: Travel and transport within and between Provinces varies according to the COVID-19 measures in place. Any change in the COVID-19 situation in a province or municipality may mean inter-provincial or municipal transport links also change and curfews may be imposed. <br>
Face masks must be worn at all times when travelling on buses, in taxis, and private hire vehicles. <br>
Visitors are allowed to hire cars but should check with the hire companies if they are open, have cars available, and where you can drive to under current COVID-19 measures, before making plans. <br>
Check with your tour operator and seek local advice if you have questions about excursions to other parts of Cuba, including whether car hire is allowed. <br>
*Accommodation: Hotels and guest houses are open. Guests may have to wear face masks in some hotel areas and facilities. <br>
Campsites are also open. <br>
Medical teams in hotels will check on health of guests, including taking their temperature, and will be available to guests who feel unwell in between those visits. Local medical representatives will visit campsites and “casas particulares” (private guest house). Anyone with respiratory symptoms may be moved to a clinic or isolation centre and will have to pay for PCR test(s) and medical services by credit card. Any travelling companion may be required to self-isolate in their accommodation pending a negative PCR test result, or be tested themselves. <br>
Hotels may limit the numbers of people using facilities at any one time, especially swimming pools (if open) and elevators. <br>
*Public spaces and services: Wearing a face mask in public is compulsory, as is social distancing of a minimum of 1.5 metres. <br>
Anyone who does not follow local rules can be fined or even prosecuted. <br>
