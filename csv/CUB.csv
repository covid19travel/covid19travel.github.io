International Restrictions:<br>
*Entry to Cuba: From 10 January 2021, everyone travelling to Cuba must have a certified proof of a negative result of a PCR test taken within 72 hours before travel at an accredited testing centre in the UK or the country you are travelling from. Children are not exempt. You should arrange to take a private test. You will still be given a PCR test on arrival in Cuba. Everyone has to complete a Health Declaration (with the address of where they will be staying) and have a PCR test. From 1 December, all air tickets will have a sanitary fee of $30 included. If you have to pay for a PCR test, e.g. arriving by boat, the cost is payable by credit card, or in USD or GBP or Euros cash. The test result should be communicated within 48 hours. Travel insurance with cover for COVID-19 is required.<br>
 *Screening and quarantine: Tourists arriving on holiday charter flights will be given a PCR test on arrival. You will then be transferred to their hotels, and will be briefed on isolation rules there and further medical checks or testing at the hotel. Non-residents will be given a PCR test on arrival and will have to stay at a designated isolation centre (may be a hotel) until they have a second negative PCR test (the test may be on fifth day). The costs of the stay, test(s) and transport to and from the accommodation have to be paid by you, by credit card. It is recommended to bring cash in case your credit card does not work. Cuban nationals will also have to stay in a designated isolation centre until their second negative PCR test result. As will foreign residents of Cuba. The designated place of isolation for foreign residents will be specified by the relevant Ministry, e.g. MINCEX in the case of foreign business officials, MINREX for foreign media, and Ministry of Higher Education (MES) for foreign students. If your first PCR test is positive (even if you arrived with a certificate of a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of your departure to Cuba) you will have to go into hospital or centre being run by Ministry of Public Health. The costs of the stay in hospital or centre (and any medication) must be paid by credit card when discharged, or payment will need to be arranged directly by your travel insurance company. As a contingency, it is worth bringing cash (GBP, US Dollars or Euros) to settle the bill.
