Internal Restrictions:  <br>
*Travel in Norway: The Norwegian Government regularly monitors the risk of coronavirus, and adjusts measures in line with the levels of infection to contain the spread of the virus. <br>
Please see <a href=""https://www.helsenorge.no/koronavirus/lokal-koronainformasjon/"">guidance available online from Helsenorge  </a> for the latest information on domestic restrictions. If you do travel, check the website of the municipality (kommune) you are visiting as restrictions and recommendations between regions can vary.
See also the <a href=""https://www.regjeringen.no/en/topics/koronavirus-covid-19/id2692388/"">Norwegian Government’s coronavirus website</a>  for more detail.
Norway will accept the proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record  that contains a verifiable QR code at the border. Scottish travellers must have the latest version of the Scottish certification, which includes the verifiable QR code. If you are travelling with a printed PDF proof of vaccination status, it must date from 1 November to ensure that the certificate can be scanned successfully, if domestic certification is required. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you will be contacted by the local municipality and placed in isolation. You should let people who have been in close contact with you know. See <a href=""https://www.helsenorge.no/en/coronavirus/quarantine-and-isolation/#testing-of-close-contacts"">examples of close contacts and the rules they should follow.</a>
