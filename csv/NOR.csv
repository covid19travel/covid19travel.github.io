Internal Restrictions:  <br>
*Travel in Norway: The Norwegian Government regularly monitors the risk of coronavirus, and adjusts measures in line with the levels of infection to contain the spread of the virus. <br>
The travel-restrictions upon entry into Norway have been lifted. The same rules as prior to the corona pandemic now apply. <br>
Please see <a href=""https://www.helsenorge.no/koronavirus/lokal-koronainformasjon/"">guidance available online from Helsenorge </a> for the latest information on domestic restrictions. If you do travel, check the website of the municipality (kommune) you are visiting as restrictions and recommendations between regions can vary. <br>
See also the <a href=""https://www.regjeringen.no/en/topics/koronavirus-covid-19/id2692388/"">Norwegian Governmentâ€™s coronavirus website</a> for more detail. If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there. <br>
