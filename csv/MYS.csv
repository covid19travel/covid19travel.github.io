The situation is changing regularly, and anyone who wishes to enter Malaysia will need to seek permission from the local Malaysian Embassy or the Immigration Directorate before travelling. If you normally reside in Malaysia and wish to seek further guidance, contact the Embassy in the country you currently stay for further guidance and your airline and keep up to date with developments, including this travel advice.
