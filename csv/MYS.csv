*Testing/screen on arrival: You have to take a COVID-19 test on arrival (even if you have a negative test from your country of origin) and on completion of your quarantine. From 17 December arrivals from the UK must undertake a daily lateral flow/RTK-Ag self-test during quarantining.

We therefore recommend that you contact your nearest Malaysia embassy for advice on entry requirements. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination. <br>
