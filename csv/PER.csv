International Restrictions: <br>
*All travellers: You must complete an <a href=""https://djsaludviajero.minsa.gob.pe/dj-salud/""> affidavit</a> to enter or travel through Peru. If you have respiratory symptoms, you will need to wear two face masks or a KN95 mask on flights bound for Peru. <br>
Normally, you don’t need a visa to travel if the purpose of the visit is tourism. If you’re travelling for any other purpose, check entry clearance requirements with the Peruvian Consulate-General in your country. <br>
Immigration: If you enter Peru overland from Ecuador, make sure your passport is stamped with a Peruvian entry stamp at the local immigration office. Most people crossing the border with Ecuador enter Peru through Aguas Verdes (Tumbes region) - you may need to ask for directions to the immigration office. If your passport is not stamped at the border with Ecuador, you can have it stamped at the Immigration Office in the city of Tumbes. <br>
If you enter Peru from Bolivia by bus or taxi, make sure your passport is stamped with a Peruvian entry stamp at the immigration office in Desaguadero or Copacabana (Puno region). <br>
Immigration authorities may also not let you leave Peru without a valid exit stamp from the last country you visited. <br>
If you enter Peru without an entry stamp then you’re required by law to apply for a new entry stamp at the nearest immigration office. The immigration authorities will need you to provide your passport and evidence of your entry to Peru, eg air/bus ticket in your name, exit stamp from the last country you visited, and any other documentation they deem necessary. If you’re unable to provide any such evidence you must apply for an exit or expulsion order at the Immigration Office in Lima. You won’t be allowed to leave Peru without this, and you may be prevented from re-entering Peru for the next five to ten years. <br>
Please note that passports are not stamped when you enter Peru through Jorge Chavez inter-national airport in Lima. Your details will be recorded in the immigration database and will be available when you leave Peru. <br>
*If you’re fully vaccinated: If you’re fully vaccinated, you can enter Peru without needing to test or quarantine. <br>
Peruvian nationals and foreign nationals resident in Peru aged 12 and over whose final destination is Peru must show evidence of full vaccination (3 doses) received either in Peru or abroad. Foreign nationals who do not reside in Peru aged 12 and over whose final destination is Peru must show evidence of full vaccination according to the scheme of their country of origin. Those under 12 years old must be without COVID-19 symptoms but do not require a test or proof of vaccination. These rules are subject to change at short notice. <br>
Anyone who shows COVID-19 symptoms on arrival in Peru must isolate by law. <br>
Proof of vaccination status: You must present proof that you have been fully vaccinated to enter Peru. <br>
Peru will accept the proof of COVID-19 vaccination and that issued in the Crown Dependencies. Although digital proof is accepted, you should also take a hard copy. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
*If you’re not fully vaccinated: Unvaccinated arrivals aged 12 and above, need to show proof of a negative PCR test (issued no more than 48 hours before boarding) when entering Peru. <br>
*Children and young people: Children aged under 12 do not need to show proof of vaccination to enter Peru. Any child who shows COVID-19 symptoms on arrival in Peru must isolate by law. <br>
*If you’re transiting through Peru: Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination. <br>
If you are transiting through Peru on your way to another country and staying in the airport (airside) you do not need to meet the vaccination and PCR requirements to enter Peru as above.<br>
If you are transiting through Peru on your way to another country and will be passing through immigration (sometimes known as a layover), for whichever reason, you need to meet the full requirements to enter Peru as above. <br>
*Exemptions: There are no exemptions for Peru’s entry requirements.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
 Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Travel in Peru: A state of emergency continues to be in force in Peru due to COVID-19. <br>
Two masks (one cloth, one surgical) or a KN95 mask must be worn in health centres, in land-transport service vehicles, and in closed spaces without ventilation. The use of masks outdoors and in closed spaces with ventilation is optional. Anyone with respiratory symptoms must wear a mask at all times. Please follow local authorities’ instructions. <br>
