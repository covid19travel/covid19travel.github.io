International Restrictions: <br>
*All travellers: You will need to wear two face masks or a KN95 mask on flights bound for Peru and must complete an <a href=""https://djsaludviajero.minsa.gob.pe/dj-salud/"">affidavit </a> to enter or travel through Peru as a visitor. <br>
Normally, you don’t need a visa to travel if the purpose of the visit is tourism. If you’re travelling for any other purpose, check entry clearance requirements with the Peruvian Consulate-General in your city. 
*If you’re fully vaccinated: If you’re fully vaccinated, you can enter Peru without needing to test or quarantine. <br>
Peruvian nationals and foreign nationals resident in Peru aged 12 and over whose final destination is Peru must show evidence of full vaccination (3 doses) received either in Peru or abroad. Foreign nationals who do not reside in Peru aged 12 and over whose final destination is Peru must show evidence of full vaccination according to the scheme of their country of origin. Those under 12 years old must be without COVID-19 symptoms but do not require a test or proof of vaccination. These rules are subject to change at short notice. Anyone who shows COVID-19 symptoms on arrival in Peru must isolate by law. <br>
Proof of vaccination status: You must present proof that you have been fully vaccinated to enter Peru. <br>
Peru will accept the proof of COVID-19 vaccination. Although digital proof is accepted, you should also take a hard copy. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
*If you’re not fully vaccinated: Unvaccinated arrivals aged 12 and above, need to show proof of a negative PCR test (issued no more than 48 hours before boarding) when entering Peru. 
*Children and young people: Children aged under 12 do not need to show proof of vaccination to enter Peru. Any child who shows COVID-19 symptoms on arrival in Peru must isolate by law. <br>
*If you’re transiting through Peru: Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination. <br>
If you are transiting through Peru on your way to another country and staying in the airport (airside) you do not need to meet the vaccination and PCR requirements to enter Peru as above. <br>
If you are transiting through Peru on your way to another country and will be passing through immigration (sometimes known as a layover), for whichever reason, you need to meet the full requirements to enter Peru as above. <br>
*Exemptions: There are no exemptions for Peru’s entry requirements.<br>
  <br>
  <br>

The use of masks outdoors and in closed spaces with ventilation is optional. Anyone with respiratory symptoms must wear a mask at all times. Please follow local authorities’ instructions. <br>
