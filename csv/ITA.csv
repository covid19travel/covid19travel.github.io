Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Public spaces and travel within Italy: Public spaces and services: Until at least 30 September, the use of FFP2 masks are compulsory in the following cases: <br>
•        when entering Italy by ferry, train or coach <br>
•        on public transport within the country, including boats, ferries, interregional trains, buses, subways, cars and taxis with a driver <br>
•        when visiting healthcare facilities such as hospitals and care homes <br>
Mask wearing is still recommended to wear masks in all indoor public spaces. You should pay close attention to signage when travelling and carry a mask with you at all times. Children aged 5 and under do not need to wear a mask. <br>
To visit inpatients on a hospital ward, you will require: <br>
•        a booster dose (in addition to the primary vaccination course) OR <br>
•        a primary vaccination course AND a negative test OR <br>
•        a COVID-19 recovery certificate AND a negative test <br>
Check with the ward’s health director before visiting as requirements may vary. <br>
Regional and local authorities in Italy are empowered to adjust these measures where required, which may occur at short notice. You should consult the websites for the regions in which you are travelling for the latest information. <br>
Green Pass and Super Green Pass: Green Passes or Super Green Passes are no longer required to access businesses or services in Italy. A Green Pass is still required to visit or accompany relatives in hospitals and care homes. <br>
A<a href=""https://www.salute.gov.it/portale/nuovocoronavirus/dettaglioFaqNuovoCoronavirus.jsp?lingua=italiano&id=264""> “Green Pass”</a> (website only in Italian), also known as an EU digital COVID-19 certificate, certifies vaccination, recovery or negative test result.<br>
Italy will accept the proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record as the equivalent to a Super Green Pass as long as it is in the form of a verifiable QR code.<br>
You can also obtain a <a href=""https://www.salute.gov.it/portale/nuovocoronavirus/dettaglioFaqNuovoCoronavirus.jsp?lingua=italiano&id=264"">Green Pass</a> valid for 48 hours by testing negative to a rapid COVID-19 test available from local pharmacies and test centres.
Children aged 11 and under are exempt from presenting a <a href=""https://www.salute.gov.it/portale/nuovocoronavirus/dettaglioFaqNuovoCoronavirus.jsp?lingua=italiano&id=264"">Green Pass and Super Green Pass</a>
Anyone falsifying a certificate is liable to face a fine of up to €3000 or a prison sentence. <br>

See <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/italy/coronavirus#:~:text=Public%20spaces%20and%20services"">Public spaces and services</a>.
International travel from Italy: To board an international flight from Italy, you should check the requirements for your destination country. <br>
Wearing masks for flights: The Italian government has removed the requirement to wear masks on flights in and to or from Italy. You should check with your travel operator before travelling. <br>

*If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
