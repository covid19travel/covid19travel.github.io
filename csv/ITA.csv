Consequently, in line with the newly updated lists of countries that have been published by the Italian Ministry of Health, Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brunei, Lebanon, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao are no longer part of the list.

Internal Restrictions: <br>
The Italian government has approved a new decree on 7 October (attached in its original Italian), governing access to cultural and recreational venues. It sets out the following terms, which take effect from 11 October (with Green Passes being required for admission): <br>
•        Cinemas, theatres, and concert halls: In white zones, these venues, whether indoors or outdoors, may return to 100% capacity.<br>
•        Spectator sports: In white zones, the maximum capacity for outdoor sports stadiums is 75%, while for indoor venues, the maximum capacity is 60%.<br>
•        Dance halls, night clubs, and similar venues: In white zones, these venues may reopen, but for outdoor venues, the maximum capacity is 75%, while for enclosed venues, the maximum capacity is 50%. Enclosed/indoor venues are required to employ ventilation systems without air recirculation. Masks must continue to be worn indoors, except while dancing.   <br>
On 21 September 2021, the host government signed into effect a new legislative decree (attached in its original Italian), which extends the requirement for a Green Pass to workplaces both in the public and private sectors. <br>
It stipulates that from 15 October - 31 December 2021:<br>
•  Both public and private sector employees as well as any other personnel who perform work or voluntary activities within public facilities or wherever private work is carried out must be in possession of a Green Pass and be able to display it upon request. This requirement does not apply to individuals exempted from vaccination on the basis of relevant medical certification issued in accordance with the criteria defined by the Italian Ministry of Health.<br>
• Employers are responsible for ensuring that their respective employees are in compliance with this requirement and must establish the appropriate modalities for such verification (even through random sampling) by 15 October. Ideally these checks should be carried out by formally designated personnel at the point of access to the workplace.<br>
• Public sector personnel in violation of the requirement for a Green Pass will be noted as an unjustified absence and upon the fifth day of unjustified absence will be suspended without pay until a Green Pass is presented. Private sector workers in violation of the requirement for a Green Pass are to be suspended without pay. Employers with less than 15 employees may temporarily substitute employees without a Green Pass until a Green Pass is presented. In any case, no disciplinary action can be taken and employees shall not be terminated.<br>
• The availability of rapid antigen tests at pharmacies is to be guaranteed until 31 December at contained state-established prices (8 EUR for minors, 15 EUR for adults, and free for vulnerable categories).<br>
•        A Green Pass from a molecular (PCR) test will have a validity of 72 hours while antigen tests will continue to be valid for 48 hours.<br>
From 1 September-31 December 2021, Green Passes will be required in the following additional contexts within Italy: <br>
•        Educational system: all educational personnel and university students must present a Green Pass<br>
•        Domestic transportation aboard:<br>
o        Airplanes<br>
o        Boats and ferries for interregional transport, with the exception of the route across the Strait of Messina.<br>
o        Intercity, Intercity Notte, and high speed trains<br>
o        Buses traveling along interregional routes<br>
o        Buses used for rental services, excluding those used in additional local and regional public transport services<br>
In line with an ordinance from the Ministry of Health published on 23 June 2021, as of Monday, 28 June, in White Zones, it is no longer obligatory to wear a mask outdoors.<br>
The only exceptions to this are: <br>
•        Situations where it is not possible to guarantee adequate social distancing (1 meter) or where crowds or gatherings form<br>
•        While on the grounds of any healthcare facilities<br>
•        Whenever in the presence of individuals with impaired immune systems<br>
Please remember that you should still carry a mask on your person at all times and mask-wearing is still obligatory in any indoor spaces open to the public, including FAO Headquarters.<br>
The Italian government signed a new decree on 22 July, which takes effect today. It prescribes new criteria for the classification of regions, introduces the requirement for a Green Pass in additional venues within White Zones, and extends the state of emergency until 31 December 2021. <br>
*Classification of Regions: In terms of the new criteria for the classification of regions, classifications are now determined by ICU occupancy rates and overall rates of hospitalization for patients with COVID-19: <br>
•        White Zones: 10% or less of ICU beds and 15% or less of hospital beds overall in a region occupied by COVID-19 patients<br>
•        Yellow Zones: 11-20% ICU beds or 16-30% hospital beds overall occupied by COVID-19 patients<br>
•        Orange Zones:  21-30% ICU beds or 31-40% hospital beds overall occupied by COVID-19 patients<br>
•        Red Zones: 31%+ ICU beds or 41%+ hospital beds overall occupied by COVID-19 patients<br>
Green Pass Requirements<br>
From 6 August, a Green Pass will be required to access the following: <br>
•        Indoor dining with table service in any food service venues (including restaurants, cafes, and pubs) <br>
•        Any shows, events, or sports competitions open to the public<br>
•        Museums, exhibits, and any other cultural institutions<br>
•        Any indoor pools, swim centers, gyms, participation in team sports, wellness centers – including those within hotels or other hospitality facilities<br>
•        Festivals and fairs, conferences and conventions<br>
•        Spas and amusement parks<br>
•        Any indoor cultural or recreational centers, with the exception of those for children<br>
•        Arcades, betting halls, bingo halls, and casinos. <br>
EU Digital COVID Certificates are not the only acceptable forms of Green Passes within Italy. Proof of a first dose will be sufficient as well. <br>
The other two forms of Green Passes are a negative COVID-19 test (valid for 48 hours) or proof of recovery from COVID-19 within the last 6 months. <br>
•        White Zones: Zones classified as having a ‘low’ level of risk: the whole country is now classified as White Zone.<br> 
o        Curfew ceases to apply <br>
o        Any activities must conform to relevant safety and hygiene protocols and guidelines detailed in the annexes of the latest legislative decree <br>
o        Activities allowed: wedding receptions, conferences and trade shows/exhibitions may take place; indoor pools, spas, arcades, betting halls, casinos, and recreational centers may reopen; indoor sports competitions may admit audiences up to 25% of capacity. <br>
o        Activities in dance halls and nightclubs or similar whether indoors or outdoors continue to be suspended. <br>
o        Mask-wearing, hand-washing, and social distancing continue to be required <br>
o        For indoor dining, tables may have a maximum of 6 occupants. <br>
o        Sardinia has extended the requirement for a Green Pass to enter the region until 15 June. <br>
 As a reminder, these are the general rules to continue to follow:<br>
 • Measures that are always required:<br>
 o Masks: It is mandatory to have a mask on one's person at all times, to be worn in public both in enclosed areas and outdoors, except in cases where social distancing is continuously guaranteed. Exceptions to this requirement apply for children under the age of 6 and for persons with medical conditions incompatible with the use of a mask.
