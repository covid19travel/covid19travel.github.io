Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Public spaces and travel within Italy: Public spaces and services
Until at least 30 September, the use of FFP2 masks are compulsory in the following cases:<br>
•        when entering Italy by plane, ferry, train or coach <br>
•        on public transport within the country, including commercial flights, boats, ferries, interregional trains, buses, subways, cars and taxis with a driver <br>
•        when visiting healthcare facilities such as hospitals and care homes <br>
It is still recommended to wear masks in all indoor public spaces. You should pay close attention to signage when travelling and carry a mask with you at all times. Children aged 5 and under do not need to wear a mask. <br>
To visit inpatients on a hospital ward, you will require: <br>
•        a booster dose (in addition to the primary vaccination course) OR <br>
•        a primary vaccination course AND a negative test OR <br>
•        a Covid recovery certificate AND a negative test <br>
Check with the ward’s health director before visiting as requirements may vary. <br>
Regional and local authorities in Italy are empowered to adjust these measures where required, which may occur at short notice. You are advised to consult the websites for the regions in which you are travelling for the latest information. <br>
Green Pass and Super Green Pass: From 1 May, Green Passes or Super Green Passes are no longer required to access businesses or services in Italy. A Green Pass is still required to visit or accompany relatives in hospitals and care homes. <br>
A <a href=""https://www.salute.gov.it/portale/nuovocoronavirus/dettaglioFaqNuovoCoronavirus.jsp?lingua=italiano&id=264"">“Green Pass” </a>
 (website only in Italian), also known as an EU digital COVID certificate, certifies vaccination, recovery or negative test result. <br>
Italy will accept the proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record as the equivalent to a Super Green Pass as long as it is in the form of a verifiable QR code.<br>
You can also obtain a <a href=""https://www.salute.gov.it/portale/nuovocoronavirus/dettaglioFaqNuovoCoronavirus.jsp?lingua=italiano&id=264"">Green Pass </a> valid for 48 hours by testing negative to a rapid COVID-19 test available from local pharmacies and test centres. <br>
Children aged 11 and under are exempt from presenting a <a href=""https://www.salute.gov.it/portale/nuovocoronavirus/dettaglioFaqNuovoCoronavirus.jsp?lingua=italiano&id=264"">Green Pass and Super Green Pass (see below)</a>
Anyone falsifying a certificate is liable to face a fine of up to €3000 or a prison sentence. <br>
A Green Pass is required for accompanying non-COVID patients to hospital or specialist medical centres.
Travelling within Italy: You must comply with the local travel regulations of the region you are visiting, even if you have only just arrived in Italy. FFP2 masks must be worn on public transport until at least 30 September. <br>
International travel from Italy: To board an international flight from Italy, you should check the requirements for your destination country. <br>
