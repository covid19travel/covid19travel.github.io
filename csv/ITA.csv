<br> <br> 
The Italian government issued a new legislative decree on 17 May, which modifies the roadmap for reopening activities in Italy. It is in effect from 18 May. <br>
While the majority of the measures of the 22 April legislative decree applicable from 26 April - 31 July 2021 still apply, the following critical changes will apply: <br>
Classification of regions: The criteria for the classification of regions has been redefined such that the primary indicators are now (a) hospitalizations and ICU occupancy rates and (b) number of new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 inhabitants<br>
•        Curfew: Gradually, curfew will be lifted throughout the country:<br>
o        From 19 May, curfew starts one hour later and is thus from 23:00-5:00<br>
o        From 7 June, curfew is from 00:00-5:00<br>
o        From 21 June, curfew will be lifted altogether<br>
o        As a reminder, in White Zones, there is no curfew at any point.<br>
•        In Yellow Zones, the following timeline for reopening activities will apply:<br>
o        22 May: Malls, shopping centers, markets, and business parks may open on weekends<br>
o        24 May: Gyms may reopen<br>
o        1 June: Foodservice activities (including cafes, restaurants, pubs, ice cream parlors, and pastry shops) with table service will be allowed indoors as well as outdoors AND dinner service will be allowed<br>
o        Outdoor sports competitions recognized at the national level may admit audiences up to 25% of capacity. In any case, there may be a maximum of 1000 spectators for outdoor venues.
o        15 June: Weddings: both indoor and outdoor wedding receptions will be allowed, but guests will need to possess a Certificazione Verde (aka Green Pass). Conferences and trade shows/exhibitions are allowed to take place.<br>
o        1 July: Indoor pools, spas, amusement parks, arcades, betting halls, casinos, and recreational centers may reopen. Indoor sports competitions may admit audiences up to 25% of capacity and in any case, a maximum of 500 spectators<br>
As a reminder, these are the general rules to continue to follow:<br>
•        Measures that are always required:<br>
o        Masks: It is mandatory to have a mask on one's person at all times, to be worn in public both in enclosed areas and outdoors, except in cases where social distancing is continuously guaranteed. Exceptions to this requirement apply for children under the age of 6 and for persons with medical conditions incompatible with the use of a mask. Masks also do not need to be worn when engaging in physical activity or while consuming food or beverages. The use of masks is strongly recommended in one's own residence in the presence of visitors.
o        Social distancing continues to be required; 1 meter interpersonal distance at all times!<br>
o        Wash your hands frequently <br>
•        Domestic travel:<br>
o        Travel between regions classified as Yellow or White Zones will be allowed <br>
o        To travel between Orange and Red regions, persons will need a vaccine pass, also known as Certificazione verde or Green Pass. A Green Pass is required for such travel for anybody over the age of 2. Persons traveling between Orange/Red regions for work, health, or other urgent reasons are exempt from this requirement and need only present a self-certification form declaring their motive for travel.<br>
•        Certificazione verde or Green Pass:<br>
o        The following persons may be granted a Green Pass:<br> 
•        those who have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19<br>
•        those who have fully recovered from COVID-19<br>
•        those who have a negative COVID-19 test (rapid antigen or molecular) from the past 48 hours.<br>
•        Again, infants under the age of 2 are exempt from having to undergo a COVID-19 test and thus do not need a Green Certificate to travel.<br>
o        Green Passes are issued by:<b>
•        the facility that gave you your vaccine<br>
•        the facility where you were hospitalized for COVID-19 or your GP<br>
•        the facility that administered your COVID-19 test (including pharmacies)<br>
o        Vaccine passes granted within the EU are also valid in Italy<br>
The Italian government will review the epidemiological situation every two weeks and may issue amendments to measures.
