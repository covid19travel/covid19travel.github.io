Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Public spaces and travel within Italy: <br>
Public spaces and services: If you are visiting a healthcare facility such as a hospital ward, care home, or doctorâ€™s office, you must wear a FFP2 mask. <br>
You may be asked to provide a negative test result. This can be either a rapid antigen test taken within the previous 48 hours, or a PCR test taken within the previous 72 hours. Self-tests are not accepted. Check with the local health authority or healthcare facility before visiting. <br>
Regional and local authorities in Italy are empowered to adjust these measures where required, which may occur at short notice. You should consult the websites for the regions in which you are travelling for the latest information. <br>
*If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
