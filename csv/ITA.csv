Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Public spaces and travel within Italy: Public spaces and services: The use of FFP2 masks is no longer compulsory on public transport. <br>
Until at least 31 October, the use of FFP2 masks are compulsory when visiting healthcare facilities such as hospitals and care homes. <br>
Mask wearing is still recommended in all indoor public spaces. You should pay close attention to signage when travelling and carry a mask with you at all times. Children aged 5 and under do not need to wear a mask. <br>
To visit or accompany inpatients on a hospital ward or care home, you will require: <br>
•        a booster dose (in addition to the primary vaccination course) OR <br> 
•        a primary vaccination course AND a negative test OR <br>
•        a COVID-19 recovery certificate AND a negative test <br>
Check with the ward’s health director before visiting as requirements may vary. <br>
You can use a <a href=""https://www.salute.gov.it/portale/nuovocoronavirus/dettaglioFaqNuovoCoronavirus.jsp?lingua=italiano&id=264""> “Green Pass”</a> (website only in Italian), also known as an EU digital COVID-19 certificate, to certify vaccination, recovery or negative test result. <br>
Italy will accept the proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record as the equivalent to a Green or Super Green Pass as long as it is in the form of a verifiable QR code. <br>
You can also obtain a <a href=""https://www.salute.gov.it/portale/nuovocoronavirus/dettaglioFaqNuovoCoronavirus.jsp?lingua=italiano&id=264"">Green Pass</a>   valid for 48 hours by testing negative to a rapid COVID-19 test available from local pharmacies and test centres. <br>
Children aged 11 and under are exempt from presenting a <a href=""https://www.salute.gov.it/portale/nuovocoronavirus/dettaglioFaqNuovoCoronavirus.jsp?lingua=italiano&id=264"">Green Pass and Super Green Pass</a>. Anyone falsifying a certificate is liable to face a fine of up to €3000 or a prison sentence. <br>
Regional and local authorities in Italy are empowered to adjust these measures where required, which may occur at short notice. You should consult the websites for the regions in which you are travelling for the latest information. <br>
Travelling within Italy: You must comply with the local travel regulations of the region you are visiting, even if you have only just arrived in Italy. <br>
*International travel from Italy: To board an international flight from Italy, you should check the requirements for your destination country.
Wearing masks for flights: The Italian government has removed the requirement to wear masks on flights in and to or from Italy. You should check with your travel operator before travelling. <br>
Consult the European Union’s <a href=""https://reopen.europa.eu/en/map/ITA"">Re-Open EU page  </a> for rules on travelling within the EU. <br>
*If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
