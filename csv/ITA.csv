Internal Restrictions: <br>
The host government has announced that the COVID-19 state of emergency in Italy, which had been declared on 31 January 2020, will come to an end on 31 March 2022. With this decision, the following key milestones have thus far been established (with a more detailed roadmap for returning to normal still to come): <br>
•        1 March: No more quarantine for travelers arriving from non-EU countries. Only a standard Green Pass will be needed to enter Italy: either proof of vaccination, recovery  from COVID-19, or a negative test. <br>
•        1 April: 1st day of post-emergency phase. Masks will no longer be required outdoors and the system for different color regions will be abolished. Schools will no longer implement quarantine for close contact and FFP2 masks will no longer be required in classrooms.<br>
•        15 June: the requirement for a Super Green Pass will continue to apply until 15 June for persons over 50 to go to work. The vaccine mandate for persons over 50 will also cease to apply on this date.<br>
Further details on the easing of restrictions, including the scaling back of Green Passes, are yet to be defined and will be communicated as soon as definitive decisions are announced.<br>
Italian Government signed an Ordinance which is in effect from Friday, 11 February to 31 March 2022. <br>
It stipulates the following regarding mask-wearing throughout the country: <br>
•        Face masks must be worn in all indoor spaces, with the exception of private households <br>
•        While local laws may introduce more stringent requirements, individuals are now simply required to have a mask on them at all times, which may be worn outdoors in situations where crowds or gatherings may form. <br>
On Friday, 4 February 2022, Italy Government published a legislative decree (attached in its original Italian) , which took effect from Saturday, 5 February 2022. It stipulates the following: <br>
Extended validity of EU Digital COVID Certificates<br>
•        EU Digital COVID Certificates for people with three doses now have indefinite validity; in other words, they no longer expire. <br>
•        EU Digital COVID Certificates for people with at least two doses plus registered recovery from COVID-19 now have indefinite validity; in other words, they no longer expire. <br>
Foreigners with expired Super Green Pass/ non-EMA recognized vaccines<br>
For individuals originating from a foreign country who have a valid certificate from relevant foreign health authorities confirming: <br>
•        recovery from COVID-19  from over 6 months ago (i.e. expired Super Green Pass)<br>
•        completion of the primary vaccination cycle with an EMA-recognized vaccine from over 6 months ago (i.e. expired Super Green Pass)<br>
•        OR have received non-EMA-recognized vaccines<br>
access will be allowed to venues/services requiring a Super Green Pass upon presentation of a negative antigen or molecular COVID-19 Test from the previous 48 hours. <br>
A COVID-19 test is not required to access services in cases where individuals have received two doses of an EMA-recognized vaccine plus have proof of subsequently recovering from COVID-19. <br>
Red Zones: Red Zone restrictions do not apply to those in possession of a Super Green Pass. <br>
Positive Cases in Schools:
•        Nurseries and pre-schools: If there are 5 or more positive cases in a class, distance learning takes effect for a period of 5 days.<br>
•        Primary/elementary schools: If there are 5 or more positive cases in a class, distance learning + quarantine takes effect for a period of 5 days only for students lacking a valid Super Green Pass. A negative COVID-19 test is required to return to school in-person.<br>
•        Secondary/middle schools and above: If there are 2 or more positive cases in a class, distance learning + quarantine takes effect for a period of 5 days only for students lacking a valid Super Green Pass. A negative COVID-19 test is required to return to school in-person.<br>
Please recall that whenever any positive cases are confirmed in a class, regardless of the number of cases or the age group, classmates must take a COVID-19 test if symptoms arise OR on the 5th day from first contact with the positive case. <br>
Please also recall that access to learning institutions is prohibited for anyone with a body temperature over 37.5 degrees Celsius. <br>
