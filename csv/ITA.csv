Internal Restrictions: <br>
As Italy continues its transition out of the state of emergency related to COVID-19 that ended on 31 March 2022, the Ministry of Health has issued an ordinance (attached in its original Italian) to guide the country in the phase from 1 May – 15 June 2022. <br>
The main ordinance’s provisions are the following: <br>
•        FFP2 masks are mandatory only in the following situations:<br>
o        Onboard the following means of public transport: airplanes ships, ferries, trains, buses, local public transport, and school shuttles/buses/etc.<br>
o        To attend any indoor shows open to the public, whether in theatres, concert halls, cinemas, or any other entertainment venues, including for indoor sports events.<br>
•        Face masks must be worn at all times by workers, service users, and visitors in any healthcare or social care facilities, including care homes, senior housing facilities, and hospices.<br>
•        Face masks are recommended to be worn in any indoor venues open to the public, including workplaces. <br>
The Ministry of Health has introduced a second ordinance on 28 April 2022 regarding international travel to Italy. Its provisions are valid 1-31 May 2022:<br>
•        A basic Green Pass (either vaccination with an EMA-recognized vaccine, proof of recovery from COVID-19, or a negative COVID-19 test from the previous 48 hours) continues to be required for all travelers, regardless of country of origin, to enter Italy.<br>
•        A Passenger Locator Form (PLF) is no longer required to enter Italy.<br>
*Public spaces and services: From 1 May until at least 15 June the use of FFP2 masks are compulsory in the following cases: <br>
•        When entering Italy by plane, ferry, train or coach<br>
•        On public transport within the country, including commercial flights, boats, ferries, interregional trains, buses, subways, cars and taxis with a driver<br>
•        At indoor public venues such as theatres, concert halls, cinemas, live music clubs and indoor sporting events<br>
•        When visiting healthcare facilities.<br>
It is still recommended to wear masks in all indoor public spaces. You should pay close attention to signage when travelling and carry a mask with you at all times. Children aged 5 and under do not need to wear a mask.<br>
To visit inpatients on a hospital ward, you will require:<br>
•        A booster dose (in addition to the primary vaccination course) OR<br>
•        A primary vaccination course AND a negative test OR<br>
•        A Covid recovery certificate AND a negative test.<br>
Check with the ward’s health director before visiting as requirements may vary. Regional and local authorities in Italy are empowered to adjust these measures where required, which may occur at short notice. You are advised to consult the websites for the regions in which you are travelling for the latest information.<br>
*Green Pass and Super Green Pass: From 1 May, Green Passes or Super Green Passes are no longer required to access businesses or services in Italy. A Green Pass is still required to enter Italy from another country (see ‘Entry Requirements’).<br>
*Green Pass: A <a href=""https://www.salute.gov.it/portale/nuovocoronavirus/dettaglioFaqNuovoCoronavirus.jsp?lingua=italiano&id=264"">“Green Pass”</a> (website only in Italian), also known as an EU digital COVID certificate, certifies vaccination, recovery or negative test result. You can obtain a <a href=""https://www.salute.gov.it/portale/nuovocoronavirus/dettaglioFaqNuovoCoronavirus.jsp?lingua=italiano&id=264"">Green Pass</a> valid for 48 hours by testing negative to a rapid COVID-19 test available from local pharmacies and test centres. Children aged 11 and under are exempt from presenting a <a href=""https://www.salute.gov.it/portale/nuovocoronavirus/dettaglioFaqNuovoCoronavirus.jsp?lingua=italiano&id=264"">Green Pass and Super Green Pass (see below)</a>. <br>
Anyone falsifying a certificate is liable to face a fine of up to €3000 or a prison sentence. A Green Pass is required for accompanying non-COVID patients to hospital or specialist medical centres. <br>
*Super Green Pass: A <a href=""https://www.dgc.gov.it/web/faq.html#gpr"">Super Green Pass</a>, also known as an EU digital COVID certificate, certifies full vaccination or recovery. Italy will accept proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record as the equivalent to a Super Green Pass as long as it is in the form of a verifiable QR code. From 1 May, a Super Green Pass is no longer required to access businesses or services in Italy. <br>
*Travelling within Italy: You must comply with the local travel regulations of the region you are visiting, even if you have only just arrived in Italy. FFP2 masks must be worn on public transport until at least 15 June. <br>
*International travel from Italy: To board an international flight from Italy, you should check the requirements for your destination country. <br>
*Wearing masks for flights: Until at least 15 June, FFP2 masks or higher grade must be worn to travel on flights in Italy. You should take spare masks for long journeys. Check with your travel operator before travelling. <br>
