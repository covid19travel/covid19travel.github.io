Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Public spaces and travel within Italy:<br>
Public spaces and services: The following COVID-19 restrictions should be followed: <br>
•        The mandatory use of masks whilst indoors. Children aged 5 and under do not need to wear a mask. You should pay close attention to signage when travelling and carry a mask with you at all times. The use of FFP2 masks is compulsory on public transport, in theatres, concert halls and cinemas and for sporting events until at least 31 March. You cannot consume food or drink in the above indoor locations. From 11 February, the use of masks is no longer mandatory in outdoor spaces, except in places of large gatherings such as sporting events. <br>
•        The use of FFP2 masks is compulsory on public transport, at indoor or outdoor public events, in theatres, concert halls, cinemas and live music clubs and for sporting events until 30 April. The use of masks is no longer mandatory in outdoor spaces, except in places of large gatherings such as sporting events. <br>
•        As of 1 April surgical masks will be sufficient in work environments. <br>
•        From 10 January a Super Green Pass is required to access facilities and services in Italy. See ‘Super Green Pass’ below <br>
•        Social distancing of one metre must be observed and gatherings should be avoided <br>
Regional and local authorities in Italy are empowered to adjust these measures where required, which may occur at short notice. You are advised to consult the websites for the regions in which you are travelling for the latest information. <br>
Green Pass and Super Green Pass:
Green Pass: A  <a href=""https://www.salute.gov.it/portale/nuovocoronavirus/dettaglioFaqNuovoCoronavirus.jsp?lingua=italiano&id=264"">“Green Pass” </a> (website only in Italian), also known as an EU digital COVID certificate, certifies vaccination, recovery or negative test result. All travellers aged 12 and above must present a Green Pass or Super Green Pass to board an international flight from Italy. See ‘International Travel from Italy’ below.
You can obtain a <a href=""https://www.salute.gov.it/portale/nuovocoronavirus/dettaglioFaqNuovoCoronavirus.jsp?lingua=italiano&id=264"">Green Pass  </a>  valid for 48 hours by testing negative to a rapid COVID-19 test available from local pharmacies and test centres. The test provider will print your test results and will email you a unique code. You will then need to access the <a href=""https://www.dgc.gov.it/spa/public/home"">Government website</a> (in Italian) and enter your details. Select the option ‘Utente senza tessera sanitaria’ (‘User without a health card’). You will be prompted to enter the type and number of the ID you showed when you got your test, as well as the code on your test certificate. Click ‘Ricupera certificazione’ (‘Get certificate’) to download your digital test result. <br>
Children aged 11 and under are exempt from presenting a <a href=""https://www.salute.gov.it/portale/nuovocoronavirus/dettaglioFaqNuovoCoronavirus.jsp?lingua=italiano&id=264"">green pass and Super Green Pass (see below). </a> Anyone falsifying a certificate is liable to face a fine of up to €3000 or a prison sentence. <br>
Super Green Pass: A <a href=""https://www.dgc.gov.it/web/faq.html#gpr"">Super Green Pass</a>, also known as an EU digital COVID certificate, certifies full vaccination or recovery. <br>
Until 30 April a Super Green Pass is required to access indoor restaurants and bars, hotels, as well as museums, cultural centres, sports facilities and stadiums. A Super Green Pass is also needed to access outdoor facilities such as swimming pools, wellness centres, ski lifts and to participate in celebrations following civil and religious ceremonies. As of 1 April the Super Green Pass is no longer mandatory for outdoor restaurants and bars and on public local and regional transport. <br>
Italy will accept the proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record as the equivalent to a Super Green Pass as long as it is in the form of a verifiable QR code. <br>
Once in Italy, a primary vaccination certificate (demonstrating both doses of a two-dose vaccine or one dose of a one-dose vaccine) serving as a Super Green Pass has a validity of 180 days from the date of the last vaccine. A recovery certificate also has a validity of 180 days from the date of the first positive test. If your primary vaccination certificate expires whilst in Italy, you can continue to access services by taking a Rapid Lateral Flow Test (valid for 48 hours) or PCR test (valid for 72 hours). <br>
The primary vaccination certificate has unlimited validity in Italy for those who have had a booster dose. <br>
Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. All recovery certificates must be accompanied by a sworn translation. <br>
Travelling within Italy: You must comply with the local travel regulations of the region you are visiting, even if you have only just arrived in Italy. FFP2 masks must be worn on public transport until 30 April.<br>
International travel from Italy: To board an international flight from Italy, all travellers aged 12 and above must be able to show a Green Pass or Super Green Pass. <br>
If you are unvaccinated, you can obtain a Green Pass by testing negative to a rapid COVID-19 test available from local pharmacies. You must obtain the green pass no earlier than 48 hours prior to your flight departure. <br>
Wearing masks for flights: Until 30 April, FFP2 masks or higher grade must be worn to travel on flights in Italy. You should take spare masks for long journeys. Check with your travel operator before travelling. <br>
Consult the European Union’s <a href=""https://reopen.europa.eu/en/map/ITA"">Re-Open EU page  </a> for rules on travelling within the EU. <br>
*If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
