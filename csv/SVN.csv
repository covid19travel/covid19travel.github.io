Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Moving around in Slovenia: Movement between all statistical regions is permitted.
*Public spaces and further measures: Surgical or FFP2 type facemasks are mandatory in all enclosed public spaces, including on public transport. Surgical or FFP2 facemasks are recommended in open places and outside where a distance of 1.5 metres cannot be maintained. Fabric masks are not permitted. <br>
There are no requirements for children under the age of six to wear facemasks. Facemasks are also not required to be worn by primary school pupils up to 5th grade when in classrooms, and people practicing non-contact sports, if a distance of 3 metres can be maintained. <br>
Many of the rules apply across all of Slovenia, but some rules are specific to regions depending on their Covid-rating. You can find the status of a specific statistical region on the <a href=""https://www.gov.si/zbirke/seznami/ukrepi-za-zajezitev-sirjenja-covid-19-po-regijah/""> Slovenian Government website</a>.
From 21 February 2022, the requirement to demonstrate your COVID-19 status (known locally as ‘PCT’) to access services has been removed, with the exception of those accessing services in hospitals, healthcare, social care and prisons. Full details can be found on the Slovene Government website. The following proof can be used in order to demonstrate your COVID-19 status to access the services in hospitals, health care, social care or prisons: <br>
•        Proof of full vaccination (as outlined below in ‘Proof of vaccination’) <br>
•        Proof of a negative PCR test (taken within 72 hours), or a negative rapid antigen test (taken within 48 hours). <br>
•        Proof of recovery from COVID-19 (dated more than 10 days ago and less than six months ago). <br>
From 19 February 2022, a person who has been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 will no longer be required to self-isolate at home. They should continue to inform all those with whom they have been in contact. It is also recommended that those in close contact with a positive case from their household self-test for 7 days. <br>
From 19 February 2022, rapid antigen testing is no longer free. Self-administered rapid antigen tests are available to buy from pharmacies. <br>
*Proof of vaccination: You will only be required to demonstrate proof of vaccination to access the services in hospitals, health care, social care or prisons. The Slovene government recognises vaccination certificates, which conform to the EU Digital Covid Status Certification framework, illustrating that you are fully vaccinated with a vaccine authorised by the European Medical Authority. This means: <br>
•        7 days after a second dose of Oxford/AstraZeneca, Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna <br>
•        28 days after a single dose of Johnson & Johnson <br>
•        7 days after a single injection for those able to demonstrate they have already been infected (this only applies to those vaccinated in Slovenia) <br>
Slovenia will accept the proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. If you are travelling with a printed PDF proof of vaccination status, it must date from 1 November or after to ensure that the certificate can be scanned successfully, if domestic certification is required. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. From 1 February 2022, people aged 18 and above, will need to show proof that their second COVID-19 vaccination was received no more than 270 days previously. Vaccination certificates issued after a booster dose of Moderna or Pfizer will also be considered as proof of vaccination and is not subject to the 270 day limit. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Those vaccinated in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland can also choose to scan and save the QR code into France’s “TousAntiCovid” app. The Slovene government provides <a href=""https://www.gov.si/en/topics/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/"">English-language coronavirus guidance and updates</a>.
