Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Moving around in Slovenia: Movement between all statistical regions is permitted. <br>
*Public spaces and further measures: You are no longer required to wear a mask in public areas, including public transport. Masks remain recommended in enclosed spaces and must continue to be worn in health care and social care settings. <br>
The requirement to demonstrate your COVID-19 status (known locally as ‘PCT’) to access services has been removed, with the exception of those accessing services in hospitals, healthcare and social care. Full details can be found on the <a href=""https://www.gov.si/en/topics/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/measures-to-contain-the-spread-of-covid-19-infections/"">Slovene Government website</a> (in English). The following proof can be used in order to demonstrate your COVID-19 status to access the services in hospitals, health care and social care:<br>
•        Proof of full vaccination (as outlined below in ‘Proof of vaccination’)<br>
•        Proof of a negative PCR test (taken within 72 hours), or a negative rapid antigen test (taken within 48 hours).<br>
•        Proof of recovery from COVID-19 (dated more than 10 days ago and less than six months ago).<br>
A person who has been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 will no longer be required to self-isolate at home. They should continue to inform all those with whom they have been in contact. It is also recommended that those in close contact with a positive case from their household self-test for 7 days.<br>
Rapid antigen testing is no longer free in most circumstances. Eligibility for free rapid antigen testing can be found on the <a href=""https://www.gov.si/en/topics/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/measures-to-contain-the-spread-of-covid-19-infections"">Slovene Government website</a>. Self-administered rapid antigen tests are available to buy from pharmacies.<br>
*Proof of vaccination: You will only be required to demonstrate proof of vaccination to access the services in hospitals, health care and social care. The Slovene government recognises vaccination certificates, which conform to the EU Digital Covid Status Certification framework, illustrating that you are fully vaccinated with a vaccine authorised by the European Medical Authority. This means:<br>
•        7 days after a second dose of Oxford/AstraZeneca, Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna<br>
•        28 days after a single dose of Johnson & Johnson<br>
•        7 days after a single injection for those able to demonstrate they have already been infected (this only applies to those vaccinated in Slovenia)<br>
Slovenia will accept proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. From 1 February 2022, people aged 18 and above, will need to show proof that their second COVID-19 vaccination was received no more than 270 days previously. Vaccination certificates issued after a booster dose of Moderna or Pfizer will also be considered as proof of vaccination and is not subject to the 270 day limit. <br>
