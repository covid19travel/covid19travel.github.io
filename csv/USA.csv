Internal Restrictions: <br>
CDC advises avoiding travel to 15 countries because of COVID-19 . The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported to ""avoid travel"" to Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Fiji, Guadeloupe, Jamaica, Kuwait, Mongolia, Niger, Peru, Romania, St Barthelemy, St Martin/St Maarten, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates because of COVID-19. If you must travel, make sure you are fully vaccinated.<br>
Given what we [the CDC] currently know about COVID-19 and the Omicron variant, CDC is shortening the recommended time for isolation from 10 days for people with COVID-19 to five days, if asymptomatic, followed by five days of wearing a mask when around others. Additionally, CDC is updating the recommended quarantine period for those exposed to COVID-19. For people who are unvaccinated or are more than six months out from their second mRNA dose (or more than two months after the J&J vaccine) and not yet boosted, CDC now recommends quarantine for five days followed by strict mask use for an additional five days. Alternatively, if a five-day quarantine is not feasible, it is imperative that an exposed person wear a well-fitting mask at all times when around others for 10 days after exposure. Individuals who have received their booster shot do not need to quarantine following an exposure, but should wear a mask for 10 days after the exposure. For all those exposed, best practice would also include a test for SARS-CoV-2 at day five after exposure. If symptoms occur, individuals should immediately quarantine until a negative test confirms symptoms are not attributable to COVID-19.<br>
.*Travel in USA: Many airports in the USA have implemented safety measures designed to limit the spread of COVID-19. You should check the website of the airport you are flying into or transiting to see how these could affect you. <br>
On 21 January 2021 President Biden signed an Executive Order requiring masks to be worn on airplanes, trains, buses and at airports. <br>
Some states have rules in place requiring travellers from other states, with high rates of COVID-19, to quarantine or to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test. Before travelling you should check the websites of the relevant state governments. Further information can be found on the <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/publichealthgateway/healthdirectories/healthdepartments.html"">CDC website</a>.
A number of US states have mandated the use of masks and face coverings while in public. These will vary from state to state and there can often be different rules within different localities in the same state. You should consult the website of the state or city to which you are travelling. Further details are found on the <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/states-and-territories"">US.GOV site</a>. Penalties for breaches of regulations will vary between each state and may sometimes vary in different areas in the same state. <br>
Some areas require proof of vaccination in order to access local amenities. In certain localities, children 17 and under may not be exempt from this requirement. With rising COVID cases across the country, many private venues, including restaurants and concert halls, are making proof of vaccination (or a recent negative COVID-19 test result) a requirement for entry. The precise requirements may vary from venue to venue so you should check on compliancy requirements in advance. <br>
*Accommodation: Hotels will be operating at capacities dictated by local rules and regulations. <br>
*Public places and services: Local regulations on shops, restaurants, bars, beaches and other leisure activities may be following measures designed to limit the spread of COVID-19. Some areas require proof of vaccination or evidence of a negative COVID-19 test in order to access local amenities. In certain localities, children 17 and under may not be exempt from this requirement. <br>
You should be aware that public places likely to attract large crowds may be closed at short notice. You should follow local media and any guidance issued by local authorities. <br>
On 9 September 2021 President Biden announced details of a 6-pronged national COVID-19 action plan. This includes requiring all employers with over 100 employees to ensure their workers are vaccinated or tested weekly. You can find details and requirements of the White House COVID-19 plan on the <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/covidplan/"">White House website</a>.
*If you test positive while in the USA you will be required to quarantine in a private area, likely a hotel or private residence. The length of time will depend on the guidance in the state where you are residing. This applies to those under 18 as well. You may also be contacted by local authorities to advise to isolate if you were in close contact with someone else who tested positive. Any assistance for those required to isolate will depend on the local authority. You should check the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-planner/index.html"">travel planner </a>to verify local state guidance.
