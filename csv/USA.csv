International Restrictions:  <br>
*All travellers: You will need to get a visa or an Electronic System for Travel Authorisation (ESTA) visa waiver to enter or transit the USA as a visitor. You should consult the <a href=""https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas.html""> US State Department website </a> to determine which you will need. <br>
You should be aware that if you have travelled to or have been in Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen on or after 1 March 2011, you are normally not eligible for an ESTA visa waiver and will need to apply for a US visa. <br>
You should also be aware that if you have travelled to or have been in Cuba, you may not be eligible for an ESTA visa waiver and may need to apply for a US visa. You should consult the <a href=""https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas.html"">US State Department website</a> to determine which you will need. <br>
The US Embassy advise that travellers who come under the following categories should not attempt to travel on an ESTA and should instead apply for a visa: those who have been arrested (even if the arrest did not result in a criminal conviction); those who have a criminal record; those who have been refused admission into, or have been deported from the USA; those who have previously overstayed under an ESTA. <br>
**If you’re fully vaccinated: Most fully vaccinated foreign citizens can enter the USA. The US authorities will accept any COVID-19 vaccine approved for emergency use by the World Health Organisation or approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). These are the AstraZeneca, BIBP/Sinopharm, Covishield, Janssen, Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech and Sinovac vaccines. In addition, those who have received the full series of an active (not placebo) COVID-19 vaccine AstraZeneca or Novavax COVID-19 vaccine trials are considered vaccinated. More details are on the <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/noncitizens-US-air-travel.html"">US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>. Foreign nationals planning to travel to the USA should familiarise themselves with the new requirements on the CDC website before booking any travel, especially if you are travelling from China, Hong Kong or Macau as new requirements begin on 5 January 2023.<br>
All current visa holders based in the USA who leave the country and then re-enter will need to follow the vaccine entry requirements unless they have an exception. This includes students on F-1 and M-1 visas and those previously issued with an existing National Interest Exception. <br>
All air passengers to the USA are also required to provide contact information to their airlines before boarding. You should check with your airline before you travel for more details. Effective from Sunday 12 June 2022 at 00:01 ET (5:01 am BST), the <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/international-travel-during-covid19.html"">CDC </a> no longer require pre-departure COVID-19 testing for USA-bound air travellers. <br>
Upon arrival, fully vaccinated travellers: <br>
•        do not have to quarantine <br>
•        are recommended to take a viral test within 3 to 5 days of arrival in the US. <br>
If you have recovered from a documented COVID-19 infection within the past 90 days (regardless of vaccination status): <br>
•        you do not need to get a test 3 to 5 days after travel. <br>
If you are travelling domestically within the USA, individual states and territories may have their own quarantine requirements. A full list of local quarantine requirements is available on the <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/publichealthgateway/healthdirectories/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Ftravelers%2Ftravel-planner%2Findex.html"">CDC website</a>. You should check the list frequently as it is likely to change, sometimes daily, as rates of COVID-19 transmission increase or decrease. <br>
Proof of vaccination status: The USA will accept the proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered at least 14 days prior to travel. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
The <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/proof-of-vaccination.html"">CDC website</a> lists the forms of acceptable proof of COVID-19 status. This also includes the European Union Digital COVID Certificate. Other accepted methods of proof include a printout of a COVID-19 vaccination record or a COVID-19 vaccination certificate issued at national or subnational level or by an authorized vaccine provider. Alternatively, digital photos of a vaccination card or record, a downloaded vaccine record or a vaccination certificate from an official source (e.g. public health agency, government agency, or other authorised vaccine provider), or a mobile phone application without a QR code. All forms of COVID-19 status must have a personal identifier, at a minimum including full name and date of birth, that match the information on a passenger’s passport or other travel documents. It must also include the name of the official source issuing the record and the vaccine manufacturer and date(s) of vaccination. <br>
*If you’re not fully vaccinated: Only those with an exception or US Citizens, US Nationals, and US Lawful Permanent Residents will be able to enter the US unvaccinated. More details are on the <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/noncitizens-US-air-travel.html"">US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>, which includes a list of exceptions from the vaccination requirements for certain categories of non-citizens and non-immigrants. <br>
*If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year: If you’re not fully vaccinated but have tested positive for COVID-19 in the last year you still cannot enter the USA unless you meet one of the exceptions detailed on the <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/international-travel-during-covid19.html"">US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a> 
*Children and young people: Children 17 and under are exempt from the vaccination requirement. <br>
For travel, the US definition of a fully vaccinated child is the same as the definition of a fully vaccinated adult. <br>
After arrival in the US, children 17 and under that are not fully vaccinated may be required to attest that they will take a test 3 to 5 days and will self-isolate should any symptoms develop or if they test positive. A parent or other authorized person should attest on behalf of a passenger 17 and under. More details are on the 
<a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/noncitizens-US-air-travel.html"">US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>.

Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Travel in USA: Many airports in the USA have implemented safety measures designed to limit the spread of COVID-19. You should check the website of the airport you are flying into or transiting to see how these could affect you. <br>
A number of US states no longer mandate the use of masks and face coverings while in public. However, the guidance will vary from state to state and there can often be different rules within different localities in the same state. You should consult the website of the state or city to which you are travelling. Further details are found on the <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/states-and-territories"">USA.GOV  </a> site. Penalties for breaches of regulations will vary between each state and may sometimes vary in different areas in the same state. <br>
Some areas require proof of vaccination in order to access local amenities. In certain localities, children 5 to 17 years may not be exempt from this requirement. Some private venues, including restaurants and concert halls, have made proof of vaccination (or a recent negative COVID-19 test result) a requirement for entry. The precise requirements may vary from venue to venue so you should check on compliancy requirements in advance. <br>
*Accommodation: Hotels will be operating at capacities dictated by local rules and regulations. <br>
*Public places and services: Local regulations on shops, restaurants, bars, beaches and other leisure activities may be following measures designed to limit the spread of COVID-19. Some areas require proof of vaccination or evidence of a negative COVID-19 test in order to access local amenities. In certain localities, children aged 5 to 17 years may not be exempt from this requirement. <br>
*If you test positive while in the USA, you may be required to isolate in a private area, likely a hotel or a private residence. Isolation requirements will depend on the guidance in the state where you are residing/visiting. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html"">recommends</a> a minimum isolation period of at least five full days. Any assistance for those required to quarantine will depend on the local authority. The CDC has <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html"">updated guidance  </a> with recommendations for what to do if you have been exposed to someone with COVID-19. You should check the CDC <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-planner/index.html"">travel planner</a> to verify local state guidance.","<a href=""https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/usa"">Foreign travel advice, Gov.UK</a>/
