 International Restrictions:<br>
*The authorities in Paraguay set and enforce entry rules.
*If you’re fully vaccinated: Fully vaccinated travellers aged 12 years and older can enter Paraguay by proving their full vaccination status: one or two doses, depending on the vaccine’s dose requirements for a complete scheme. Travellers aged 11 years and under are exempt from presenting proof of vaccination. <br>
The vaccination certificate must contain the following information: <br>
•        Traveller’s name <br>
•        Date of birth <br>
•        Document or passport number <br>
•        Identification of the vaccine manufacturer <br>
•        Batch number of applied doses<br>
•        Dose application date <br>
Vaccination certificates must be in English, French, Portuguese or Spanish. Certificates in other languages, including coded languages, will not be accepted. <br>
Entry to Paraguay upon arrival may be refused for not adhering to these requirements. <br>

Proof of vaccination status: You must present proof that you have been fully vaccinated to enter Paraguay. <br>
Paraguay will accept the proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
*If you’re not fully vaccinated: All travellers aged 12 years and older who are not fully vaccinated are required to show a negative COVID-19 test result (RT-PCR, LAMP or NAAT) taken no more than 72 hours prior to travel. <br>
*Children and young people: Children aged 11 years and under are exempt from the requirement to present proof of vaccination or a pre-departure test. <br>
*Exceptions: Land transit in border regions, including for commercial reasons, is allowed for a visit of up to 72 hours and up to 30 km without any of the aforementioned requirements for those who can show proof of residency in a border city. <br>
Travellers aged 12 years and over who have been infected with COVID-19 between 10 and 90 days before entering Paraguay are also exempt from the requirement to present proof of vaccination or a pre-departure test. Travellers should prove this situation by showing their positive COVID-19 test result (RT-PCR, LAMP or NAAT) or a proof of a positive antigen test. <br>

*If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
