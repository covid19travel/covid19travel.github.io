A  <a href=""https://www.government.nl/topics/coronavirus-covid-19/tackling-new-coronavirus-in-the-netherlands"">full overview of the current Dutch measures</a> is available online. A night-time curfew applies throughout the Netherlands as part of the Dutch Government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. You are not allowed to be outdoors between 10pm and 4:30am unless you have a permitted reason. See the Dutch Government’s <a href=""https://www.government.nl/topics/coronavirus-covid-19/curfew"">website</a>  for a list of permitted reasons. If it is essential for you to be outdoors during curfew hours, you must complete a self-certified declaration form, which is also available on the Dutch Government’s <a href=""https://www.government.nl/topics/coronavirus-covid-19/curfew"">website</a>, along with a limited list of exemptions.
