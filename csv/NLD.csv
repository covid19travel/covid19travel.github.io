As of 25 February, two public restrictions continue to apply. First, wearing facemasks on public transport including at stations and stops, at airports and on commercial passenger transport such as coaches and taxis. Not wearing a facemask as directed may result in a fine. Second, attendance at a large-scale event <a href=""https://www.government.nl/topics/coronavirus-covid-19/covid-certificate/coronavirus-entry-pass/pre-admission-testing-for-visitors-to-large-events"">requires a negative test result</a>. This applies to indoor locations with more than 500 visitors per event and without assigned seating e.g. a nightclub or a live music venue. More information on pre-admission tests is available on the <a href=""https://www.government.nl/topics/coronavirus-covid-19/covid-certificate/coronavirus-entry-pass/pre-admission-testing-for-visitors-to-large-events"">Dutch government’s website</a>.
In addition, the following advice applies: <br>
•        if you are visiting someone or are planning to go to a busy place: take a self-test beforehand; <br>
•        if you experience any COVID-19 symptoms, stay home and take a self-test; <br>
•        if you test positive for COVID-19 you must self-isolate. Anyone who lives with, or is travelling with someone who tests positive must self-isolate, unless they received their booster vaccination at least 1 week ago, they tested positive less than 8 weeks ago, or their employer shows that they are needed at work and meet the conditions of employees in essential business processes. This only applies if they do not have any COVID-19 symptoms. If you are unsure whether you need to self-quarantine, do the Quarantine Check. <br>
