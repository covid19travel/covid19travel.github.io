Internal Restrictions: <br> 
*Travel in the Netherlands: The latest information on Dutch domestic coronavirus measures can be found on the <a href=""https://www.government.nl/topics/coronavirus-covid-19/tackling-new-coronavirus-in-the-netherlands"">Dutch government website</a>  (in English). On 28 April the government lifted a number of lockdown measures including the evening curfew. <br>
Non-medical face masks must be worn in all publicly accessible indoor spaces, including on public transport if you are aged 13 and over. If you do not wear a face mask you might be fined ‚Ç¨95. Additionally, on platforms and stations, social distancing of 1.5 metres must be observed. <br>
The Dutch government advises to limit your travel movements as much as possible. Public transport should be used for essential journeys only. For other shared forms of transport, such as taxis, passenger vans and coaches, reservations should be made in advance and you must wear a non-medical face mask. If you‚Äôre travelling in a car or other private vehicle, you are advised to wear non-medical face masks if there are two or more people in the vehicle who belong to different households. On other forms of transport, you must stay 1.5 metres apart where possible. <br>
Schiphol, Eindhoven and Rotterdam Airports: All passengers and staff aged 13+ must wear face masks in all areas of these airports. The terminals are only open for passengers and staff. You must not be accompanied into the airport, unless absolutely necessary for a traveller with reduced mobility. <br>
*Ferries: DFDS. All travellers must wear face coverings at check-in, whilst boarding, and during disembarkation. This applies for both foot- and car passengers, as well as freight drivers. On the Amsterdam - Newcastle route, passengers must wear face coverings whilst moving around the ship. Face coverings do not need to be worn when travellers are in their cabins, seated in a socially distanced manner or whilst social distancing on outside decks. <br>
*P&O: All travellers must wear a face mask during their journey. <br>
*Eurostar: All passengers aged 13+ must wear a face mask at Eurostar stations and on board trains. If you don‚Äôt have a mask you may be refused travel on Eurostar services. <br>
*Public Spaces and Services: Lockdown measures are in place across the Netherlands. A <a href=""https://www.government.nl/topics/coronavirus-covid-19/tackling-new-coronavirus-in-the-netherlands"">full overview of the current Dutch measures</a> is available online. <br>
On 28 April 2021, the Dutch government introduced a number of relaxations to the lockdown measures. The evening curfew has been lifted, outdoor dining at restaurants and caf√©s is permitted between noon and 6pm, and non-essential shops are now open without the need to make a prior appointment. The Dutch government continues to advise people to avoid busy places. Gyms, museums, cinemas, zoos, amusement parks and other public spaces remain closed until further notice. More details can be found on the <a href=""https://www.government.nl/topics/coronavirus-covid-19/news/2021/04/20/step-1-shops-and-outdoor-seating-at-restaurants-and-cafes-will-partially-reopen-evening-curfew-lifted"">Dutch government website</a> (in English). <br>
Wearing a face mask is compulsory for everyone aged 13 and over in all indoor public spaces. This includes shops, museums, cafes and theatres. You risk having to pay a ‚Ç¨95 fine if you do not wear a face mask as directed. Outdoor group sizes are limited to no more than two people from different households. The Dutch government advises against all non-essential international travel until 15 May 2021 (inclusive). Holiday travel is not classified as essential by the Dutch government as is stated <a href=""https://www.government.nl/topics/coronavirus-covid-19/tackling-new-coronavirus-in-the-netherlands/travel-and-holidays/travelling-abroad"">here</a>. <br>
You should check the latest local information before travelling, as individual regions might have imposed extra measures. <br>
You must stay 1.5 metres away from other people. This applies to everyone over the age of 18: in the street, in shops and other buildings. It does not apply to members of your household and it does not apply if you are providing assistance to someone, for example pushing a wheelchair. If you notice that it is becoming difficult to keep a distance of 1.5 metres, you should leave. Avoid busy places in general, as if a gathering poses a safety or public health risk, enforcement officers can take action. <br>
*Accommodation: Foreign tourists are not obliged to reserve their holiday accommodation before travelling to the Netherlands. More information on visiting the Netherlands as a tourist can be found <a href=""https://www.government.nl/topics/coronavirus-covid-19/tourism-in-the-netherlands"">here</a> and more information on Dutch coronavirus measures can be found <a href=""https://www.government.nl/topics/coronavirus-covid-19/tackling-new-coronavirus-in-the-netherlands/basic-rules-for-everyone"">here</a>. <br>
Hotels remain open, but hotel restaurants are closed and room service is unavailable. <br>
