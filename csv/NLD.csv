Face masks must be worn on public transport, in stations and on platforms by those aged 13 and over. If you do not wear a face mask as directed, you may be fined €95. <br>
If you’re travelling in a car or other private vehicle, you are advised to wear face masks if there are two or more people in the vehicle who belong to different households. <br>
Children under the age of 13 are not required to wear a face mask. <br>
People are now advised to wear a disposable face mask. The Dutch government advises against wearing fabric masks and homemade masks. <br>
Schiphol, Eindhoven and Rotterdam Airports: All passengers and staff aged 13+ must wear face masks in all areas of these airports. <br>
*Ferries: <br>
DFDS: All travellers must wear face coverings at check-in, whilst boarding, and during disembarkation. This applies for both foot- and car passengers, as well as freight drivers. On the Amsterdam - Newcastle route, passengers must wear face coverings whilst moving around the ship.

P&O: All travellers must wear a face mask during their journey. <br>
Eurostar: All passengers must wear a face mask on board trains, in stations and on platforms. If you don’t have a mask you may be refused travel on Eurostar services. <br>
*Public spaces and services: The Dutch Government has announced further reopening of all sectors. A full overview of measures is available on the <a href=""https://www.government.nl/topics/coronavirus-covid-19/tackling-new-coronavirus-in-the-netherlands/coronavirus-measures-in-brief"">Dutch Government’s website</a>. As of 25 February, two public restrictions continue to apply. First, wearing facemasks on public transport including at stations and stops, at airports and on commercial passenger transport such as coaches and taxis. Not wearing a facemask as directed may result in a fine. Second, attendance at a large-scale event <a href=""https://www.government.nl/topics/coronavirus-covid-19/covid-certificate/coronavirus-entry-pass/pre-admission-testing-for-visitors-to-large-events"">requires a negative test result</a>. This applies to indoor locations with more than 500 visitors per event and without assigned seating e.g. a nightclub or a live music venue. More information on pre-admission tests is available on the <a href=""https://www.government.nl/topics/coronavirus-covid-19/covid-certificate/coronavirus-entry-pass/pre-admission-testing-for-visitors-to-large-events"">Dutch government’s website</a>.
In addition, the following advice applies: <br>
•        if you are visiting someone or are planning to go to a busy place: take a self-test beforehand; <br>
•        if you experience any COVID-19 symptoms, stay home and take a self-test; <br>
•        if you test positive for COVID-19 you must self-isolate. Anyone who lives with, or is travelling with someone who tests positive must self-isolate, unless they received their booster vaccination at least 1 week ago, they tested positive less than 8 weeks ago, or their employer shows that they are needed at work and meet the conditions of employees in essential business processes. This only applies if they do not have any COVID-19 symptoms. If you are unsure whether you need to self-quarantine, do the Quarantine Check. <br>
*Accommodation: Tourists are not obliged to reserve their holiday accommodation before travelling to the Netherlands. See the <a href=""https://www.government.nl/topics/coronavirus-covid-19/tourism-in-the-netherlands""> Dutch government’s website</a> for more information on tourist travel to the Netherlands. <br>
*If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
