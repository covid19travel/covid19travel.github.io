*Entry to Japan: From 30 November 2021, foreign nationals who do not have existing resident status are not permitted to enter Japan for any purpose, other than in exceptional circumstances. <br>
You can find a description of exceptional circumstances on the <a href=""https://www.mofa.go.jp/ca/fna/page22e_000921.html#section4"">Ministry of Foreign Affairs website</a>.
This guidance also applies to foreign nationals in possession of visas issued recently who have not yet entered Japan. <br>
Further details are available on the <a href=""https://www.mofa.go.jp/ca/fna/page22e_000921.html"">Ministry of Foreign Affairs website</a> , contact your nearest Japanese embassy for more information, including if you believe you qualify for exceptional circumstances. <br>
*Re-entry to Japan: From 2 December 2021, foreign nationals with Status of Residence will be denied re-entry to Japan if they are travelling from South Africa, Eswatini, Namibia, Zambia, Malawi, Mozambique, Lesotho, Angola, Botswana or Zimbabwe. <br>
Foreign nationals with Status of Residence travelling from all other countries who leave or have left Japan with a valid re-entry permit are in principle allowed to re-enter the country. However, please note that Japan has introduced caps on the number of people permitted to arrive by plane, so bookings on some routes have been restricted or suspended. Those who do not have a valid re-entry permit will be denied re-entry; please consult the Japanese authorities for advice. Those entering the country will need to follow appropriate arrival and quarantine / self-isolation rules as set out below, and provide written evidence of a negative COVID-19 test conducted within the 72 hours before their flight departure time. You should check the Japanese government’s advice on this re-entry process on the <a href=""https://www.mofa.go.jp/ca/fna/page25e_000334.html%3c/a"">https://www.mofa.go.jp/ca/fna/page25e_000334.html</a> 
*Testing/screening on arrival: All passengers arriving in Japan are required to complete a health questionnaire before disembarkation, including contact details. They are then required to undergo a COVID-19 test at the airport. You will be asked to wait for the test results at the airport before moving to your quarantine destination. <br>
*Quarantine and self-isolation requirements: From 1 December 2021 all travellers entering Japan, whether fully vaccinated or not, must undertake 14 days of quarantine and self-isolation. For those coming from the UK, the first 6 days must be spent in quarantine in a government-provided hotel. You will need to take a COVID-19 test on days 3 and 6 (the day of arrival counts as Day 0). If the tests are negative, you will be permitted to move into self-isolation at home or in a self-arranged hotel for the remainder of the 14-day period. <br>
You will be required to sign a written pledge upon arrival which commits you to these rules. The pledge also commits you to avoiding public transport, installing Japan’s COVID-19 tracing app, and maintaining – and in some cases disclosing – your location data. You may be subject to enhanced monitoring due to the presence in the UK of the Omicron COVID-19 variant. <br>
Failure to comply with these requests could lead to you being subject to detention under the Quarantine Act. It could also result in the release of your name and information related to reducing the spread of infection and, for foreign nationals, possible revocation of your Status of Residence and subsequent deportation. <br>

*Demonstrating your COVID-19 status: Both vaccinated and unvaccinated travellers are currently subject to the same quarantine and self-isolation requirements. However, in principle, the Japanese Government does recognise the proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
*Transiting Japan: The measures listed above do not apply to passengers who are transiting through one Japanese airport and do not go through immigration. If you are transiting using different airports you will need a transit permit on arrival. <br>
To get one you will be required to demonstrate that you have not come from a country on the banned list, that you have timely onward travel plans, and that you will not use public transport to move between airports; this includes taxis. <br>
You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities. You should also check the latest entry requirements for your destination.

Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Travel in Japan: Since Japan is no longer under a State of Emergency, travel between prefectures is permitted. Measures encouraging social distancing, mask-wearing and other basic precautions remain in place. Some businesses may be closed, or operating with reduced hours. A more restrictive State of Emergency, or other rules and controls, may be imposed at short notice. You should follow the instructions of your local authority.
Local authorities may also put in place special measures for natural disaster response, including additional evacuation locations and medical procedures. <br>
*If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
