 <br>
 <br>
International Restrictions: <br>
<br>
*All travellers: The Japanese <a href=""https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/covid-19/bordercontrol.html""> Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare</a>, and <a href=""https://www.mofa.go.jp/ca/fna/page4e_001053.html"">Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a> websites have further details on the entry requirements for all travellers to Japan (including on <a href=""https://www.hco.mhlw.go.jp/fasttrack/en/"">‘Fast Track’ procedures</a>). Rules may be subject to change at short notice. <br>
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic Japan has suspended its visa waiver system and all foreign National (Overseas) who do not already hold a valid re-entry permit must obtain a visa by applying in advance. The visa application process for business study or tourism must be initiated by the sponsor in Japan using the <a href=""https://entry.hco.mhlw.go.jp/"">Entrants, Returnees Follow-up System  </a>
ERFS<a href=""https://entry.hco.mhlw.go.jp/"">online system</a> and the traveller must then apply to the Japanese Consulate-General for a visa. Note that tourists are allowed to enter from different countries and other ‘blue list’ countries (see below) only in limited circumstances, where they are on package tours and sponsored on (ERFS) by an approved Japanese travel agency. Independent tourism is not permitted. Applications for visas for family reunion visits to family members resident in Japan should be made directly to the Consulate-general and not through EFRS. <br>
You should note that bookings on some flight routes have been restricted or suspended due to COVID-19. Flight length and routing may also be impacted by the current situation in Ukraine. <br>

As part of travelling to Japan, you must:<br>
•        Complete information on the MySoS app or website, including signing a written pledge to abide by the Japanese rules on self-isolation and other COVID measures and generating a QR code. You will need to show this at check-in and on arrival in Japan. For arrivals after 7 September 2022, there is no longer a requirement to have a COVID-19 test before you fly. <br>
Some airlines may require these documents to be shown before boarding as part of their internal rules. <br>
Japan operates a red, yellow and blue ‘traffic light’ system and testing an isolation on arrival are no longer required for travellers on the ‘blue list’. <br>
Quarantine and other requirements may vary. Further details can be found in the section on vaccination status below, in the <a href=""https://www.mhlw.go.jp/content/03112200QA_EN.pdf"">Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare</a> Q&A and on the <a href=""https://www.mofa.go.jp/ca/fna/page4e_001053.html"">Ministry of Foreign Affairs website</a>.
Failure to comply with the regulations could lead to detention under the Quarantine Act, the publication of your name and information related to reducing the spread of infection, and possible revocation of your Status of Residence or deportation.<br>
It is illegal to work in Japan without the correct visa, however informal or temporary the work. You shouldn’t overstay your permission to remain in the country, as you risk arrest, detention and a heavy fine. <br>
*Vaccination requirements: There is no requirement to be vaccinated in order to enter Japan, however if you cannot prove you are triple-vaccinated with two doses of AstraZeneca, Pfizer or Moderna vaccines (or one of Johnson & Johnson) and an additional booster shot from Pfizer or Moderna, then you will be unable to use the ‘fast track’ MySos system. Note that AstraZeneca is not accepted as a valid booster.<br>
*Proof of vaccination status: You can use the COVID Pass to demonstrate your vaccination record to the Japanese authorities. Your appointment card from vaccination centers is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccination status. Residents in Japan should obtain a letter from the city or ward office before travelling. <br>
*If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year: Proof of prior infection does not afford exemptions. You must follow the rules and regulations outlined above.<br>
*Children and young people: For children under 18, provided they are accompanied by a triple-vaccinated parent (who has received their booster shot) who supervises their activities, they may follow the same rules as their parent even if the child is not fully-vaccinated. <br>
*If you’re transiting through Japan: Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination. <br>
The COVID-19 regulations and requirements outlined above do not apply to passengers who are transiting through one Japanese airport and do not go through immigration. However, transit may be precluded by airport closures, movement between terminals and delays between arriving and departing flights. Check with your airline whether your connection is feasible before boarding a flight to Japan. <br>
When transiting through Japan, you should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities. You should also check the latest entry requirements for your final destination. <br>
*Exemptions: You should contact your nearest Japanese Embassy for more information on exemptions. <br>
 <br> 
 <br>
Internal Restrictions: <br>

Measures encouraging social distancing, mask-wearing and other basic precautions remain in place even in those prefectures which are not currently under State of (Quasi) Emergency. Some businesses may be closed, operating with reduced hours, and/or limiting visitor numbers. <br>
A more restrictive State of Emergency, or other rules and controls, may be imposed at short notice. You should follow the instructions of your local authority. <br>
Local authorities may also put in place special measures for natural disaster response, including additional evacuation locations and medical procedures. <br>
