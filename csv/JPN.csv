You can find a description of exceptional circumstances on the <a href=""https://www.mofa.go.jp/ca/fna/page22e_000921.html#section4"">Ministry of Foreign Affairs website</a>.<br>

*Re-entry to Japan: Foreign nationals with Status of Residence who leave or have left Japan with a valid re-entry permit are in principle allowed to re-enter the country. However, please note that Japan has introduced caps on the number of people permitted to arrive by plane, so bookings on some routes have been restricted or suspended. Those who do not have a valid re-entry permit will be denied re-entry; please consult the Japanese authorities for advice. Those entering the country will need to follow appropriate arrival and quarantine / self-isolation rules as set out below, and provide written evidence of a negative COVID-19 test conducted within the 72 hours before their flight departure time.
