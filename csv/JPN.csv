International Restrictions: <br>
<br>
*All travellers: The Japanese <a href=""https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/covid-19/bordercontrol.html"">Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare</a>, and <a href=""https://www.mofa.go.jp/ca/fna/page4e_001053.html"">Ministry of Foreign Affairs  </a> websites have details of the entry requirements for all travellers to Japan, including the ‘fast track’ entry system. Rules may be subject to change at short notice.
As part of travelling to Japan, you must submit information to the Japanese authorities before you fly via the <a href="""">Visit Japan Web  </a> site.
For arrivals who are triple-vaccinated, there is no longer a requirement to have a COVID-19 test before you fly. You will need to show a valid certificate confirming at least three vaccinations with any of the COVID-19 vaccines on the <a href=""https://extranet.who.int/pqweb/vaccines/vaccinescovid-19-vaccine-eul-issued"">Emergency Use List of the World Health Organization (WHO)</a>. Some airlines may require these documents to be shown before boarding as part of their internal rules.
Further details can be found in the section on vaccination status below, on the <a href=""https://www.mofa.go.jp/ca/fna/page4e_001053.html"">Ministry of Foreign Affairs website  </a> and <a href=""https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/covid-19/bordercontrol.html"">Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare website</a> including the <a href=""https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/seisakunitsuite/bunya/kenkou_iryou/covid19_qa_kanrenkigyou_00016.html"">Q&A</a>
Bookings on some flight routes have been restricted or suspended due to COVID-19. Flight length and routing may also be impacted by the current situation in Ukraine. <br>
It is illegal to work in Japan without the correct visa, however informal or temporary the work. You shouldn’t overstay your permission to remain in the country, as you risk arrest, detention and a heavy fine. <br>
The visa waiver system was reactivated from 11 October, which means that short-term visitors with British citizen passports no longer need to obtain a visa prior to travelling. This includes those coming for business, tourism, and to visit family and friends. Visas are still required for long-term stays and other purposes; please consult your nearest Japanese Consulate for guidance and how to apply. <br>
Vaccination requirements:<br> 
*If you are triple vaccinated: Then you do not require a negative PCR test before flying. Valid certificates must be shown to prove vaccination with three doses of any of the COVID-19 vaccines on the <a href=""https://extranet.who.int/pqweb/vaccines/vaccinescovid-19-vaccine-eul-issued"">Emergency Use List of the World Health Organization (WHO).</a> 
*If you are not triple vaccinated: There is no requirement to be vaccinated in order to enter Japan, however if you cannot prove you are triple-vaccinated with any of the COVID-19 vaccines on the <a href=""https://extranet.who.int/pqweb/vaccines/vaccinescovid-19-vaccine-eul-issued"">Emergency Use List of the World Health Organization (WHO)</a>, then you must take a PCR test within 72 hours before your flight and show a negative certificate in the <a href=""https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/covid-19/border_test.html"">approved format</a>
*Proof of vaccination status: You can use the COVID Pass to demonstrate your vaccination record to the Japanese authorities. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccination status. Residents in Japan should obtain a letter from the city or ward office before travelling. <br>
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year: Proof of prior infection does not afford exemptions. You must follow the rules and regulations outlined above. <br>
*Children and young people: Children under 18, provided they are accompanied by a triple-vaccinated parent or legal guardian who supervises their activities, may follow the same rules as their parent even if the child is not triple-vaccinated. Minors who are not accompanied by a parent or legal guardian, for example those travelling with other family members or as part of a student group, must be triple-vaccinated or show a negative pre-flight PCR test in the same way as adults. Please contact your nearest Japanese Consulate if you require further guidance on this point. <br>
*If you’re transiting through Japan: Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
The COVID-19 regulations and requirements outlined above do not apply to passengers who are transiting through one Japanese airport and do not go through immigration. However, transit may be precluded by airport closures, movement between terminals and delays between arriving and departing flights. Check with your airline whether your connection is feasible before boarding a flight to Japan. <br>
When transiting through Japan, you should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities. You should also check the latest entry requirements for your final destination. <br>
*Exemptions: You should contact your nearest Japanese Embassy for more information on exemptions.<br>
 <br> 
 <br>
Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Travel in Japan: There are no official COVID-related restrictions on travel, dining out or other activities. However, guidance encouraging social distancing, mask-wearing and other basic precautions remains in place and compliance rates are high. <br>
More restrictive rules may be imposed at short notice. You should follow the instructions of your local authority. <br>
Local authorities may also put in place special measures for natural disaster response, including additional evacuation locations and medical procedures. <br>
*If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
