 International Restrictions:<br>
*All travellers: On 15 February, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control announced the online <a href=""https://healthapp.ncdc.gov.ng/"">Nigeria Health Declaration Form  </a> for incoming travellers. This is a requirement for all travellers to complete before travel to Nigeria. This requirement has been introduced as part of measures to combat the spread of infectious diseases. <br>
You may be asked to take part in thermal screening and/or travel history checks when arriving into Nigeria. This is to assist the Nigerian Government in the detection of diseases of public health importance.<br>
All passengers travelling to Nigeria should complete the health questionnaire either on board the aircraft before landing or on arrival at the airport.<br>
*If you’re transiting through Nigeria: All passengers travelling to Nigeria in order to transit to another country, must also register and complete the online pre-boarding health declaration at the Nigeria International Travel Portal.<br>
On arrival all passengers will be screened by Port Health Officials and be required to provide full contact details. <br>
The above guidance applicable to fully vaccinated or not fully vaccinated travellers, should be followed for all transit passengers, including those staying in the airport (airside), or passing through immigration (sometimes known as a layover).<br>
