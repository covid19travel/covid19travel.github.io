The Bhutan government has begun a relaxation of the nationwide lockdown starting 5:00 a.m. local time on Tuesday 1 September. The nationwide lockdown was imposed on 11 August. The lockdown would be eased in a phased manner in a period of 10 days. Phase one starts from Tuesday 1 September, where people are allowed to do essential activities such as walking, cycling and shopping within their localities. People were urged to wear face masks. Further easing will be carried out in phase two from 4 to 6 September, where movement of public transport within the districts will be allowed. It will be followed by phase three, which allows movement of vehicles beyond the district with prior permission from police. The lifting of lockdown will not be applicable to southern border towns that are considered high-risk areas. People living in these towns will be issued movement cards, which allows them to move within the designated zones.","<a href=""<a href=""https://www.osac.gov/Content/Report/7e3b2c4b-8089-4494-95c1-184ed67e2f03"">OSAC Travel Advisories</a>/
