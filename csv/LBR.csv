It may take several days to receive this result, so you could spend up to 10 days in the POC. <br>
If you test positive for COVID-19 while in the POC, you will be transferred from your POC to a government COVID-19 Treatment Unit at Star Base. You will only be released from the treatment unit after two consecutive negative COVID-19 tests. This could mean staying for 20 days or more. Liberian POCs and treatment units are basic.<br>
There are two approved POCs: Star Base (government facility), Bushrod Island. Fees are US$1000 for an individual; US$1200 for a couple; $15000 for families of 3 or more.

•        The organisation that has invited you should inform the chair or co-chair of the COVID-19 Incident Management System (IMS) in advance of your visit, of the purpose of your visit, the number of travellers, duration of visit, activity to be conducted, exact location you will stay, contact details while in Liberia, and address and contacts of references in Liberia.<br>

•        You must present evidence of short stay (i.e. flight ticket); you must provide details of stay including telephone number, contact person and address; you must observe preventative measures while in Liberia; <br>
•        You should provide your invitation documents. <br>

•        If your stay in Liberia is extended beyond 5 days, you must undergo PCR testing before leaving Liberia (see Coronavirus testing for departing travellers). <br>
*Humanitarian workers deploying to Liberia: If you have travelled from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal or Brazil you must follow the rules above for managed quarantine. <br>
If you have not travelled from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal or Brazil and are deploying to Liberia for a period of less than 15 days you should contact your organisation for advice on which rules to follow. If you have not travelled from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal or Brazil and are deploying to Liberia for a period of 15-60 days, you should follow a different process: <br>
•        The organisation that is deploying you should inform the chair or co-chair of the COVID-19 Incident Management System (IMS) in advance of your proposed deployment, of the purpose of your deployment, the area of deployment, exact location you will stay, and contact details while in Liberia. <br>
•        You must present a negative PCR COVID-19 test result certificate from an accredited lab within 96 hours of testing (i.e. your test sample must have been collected a maximum of 4 days before arrival in Liberia). <br>
•        You must self-isolate for 7 days, beginning the day after arrival in Liberia. You must remain in your hotel or place of lodging and inform your employer if you develop any symptoms of COVID-19. <br>
•        At the end of your 7-day self-isolation period, you must be tested for COVID-19 by the National Public Health Reference Laboratory team. Sample collection involves taking a swab of the inside of your nose and the back of your throat, using a long cotton bud, for PCR testing. Sample processing could take several days. See Testing on departure for information on test locations. <br>
•        If your PCR test result is negative, you can proceed with your deployment. If your PCR test is positive, you will be subject to Liberia’s case management guidelines. This means NPHIL will consider your care on a case-by-case basis and you may be taken to a government COVID-19 treatment unit. Private health care facilities are not currently permitted to treat COVID-19 patients. Home-based care is considered on a case-by-case basis. <br>
Exemptions to PCR testing on arrival: <br>
•        Children under the age of 5 years old are exempt from COVID-19 testing and do not require a test result certificate. However, you should check your airline’s requirements. <br>
•        Cabin crew, captains, flight engineers and first officers with layovers less than 48 hours are exempt from testing if they complete pre-boarding testing as per their airline’s policy and comply with screening procedures while in Liberia. They must complete screening on arrival and proceed to their designated flight crew hotel. If layover is more than 48 hours, cabin crew, captains, flight engineers and first officers must undergo PCR testing before leaving Liberia (see Coronavirus testing for departing travellers) <br>
•        Diplomats and their families, honorary consuls, duly accredited international organisations’ staff and Liberian diplomats must present a negative PCR COVID-19 test result certificate from an accredited lab within 96 hours of testing (i.e. your test sample must have been collected a maximum of 4 days before arrival in Liberia). Alternatively, voluntary testing at the airport is available free of charge. If you do not present a valid negative PCR COVID-19 test result certificate, NPHIL staff will seek to test you on arrival. <br>
You should arrange to take a private test. You should be prepared for travel restrictions, and changes to screening and quarantine requirements with no advance notice. <br>
*Quarantine requirements: Travellers from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal or Brazil must stay in an approved quarantine facility for a minimum of 8 days (see Travellers from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal or Brazil above). <br>
For other travellers, depending on the length and reason for your visit, you may not have to isolate on arrival. However, for the majority of travellers Liberia recommends self-isolation for 7 days after arrival. Humanitarian works staying longer than 15 days will need to isolate on arrival for 7 days and then take a further PCR test. There is a risk for foreign nationals of being put into a government quarantine or medical facility, either on arrival or during your trip to Liberia. <br>
You are at risk of being put into quarantine or instructed to self-isolate even after completing your post-arrival self-isolation, if you develop symptoms (fever, cough or respiratory illness), or it is suspected you have been in contact with some who has tested positive for coronavirus. If you test positive for COVID-19, you may be transferred to a government quarantine facility or treatment centre. You are strongly advised to familiarise yourself with these risks before travelling. <br>
If you are travelling on behalf of government, an international organisation/NGO or a company, you should check with your organisation whether they have pre-arranged a private POC, i.e. quarantine facility, authorised by NHPIL. If you show symptoms, you may be transferred to a government POC or treatment centre. Visitors arriving on a laissez-passer (except UN or EU), may also be taken to quarantine for secondary screening. Any suspicion of illegal attempts to circumvent the process will result in removal to quarantine. <br>
