International Restrictions:<br> 
*All travellers: You will need a visa to enter Côte d’Ivoire as a visitor. Anyone wishing to enter Côte d’Ivoire who does not already have a visa should make their visa application through the <a href=""https://snedai.com/e-visa/"">e-visa service online  </a> before travel. This is available in English. If you are not an ECOWAS national, you must hold a valid visa or have had your application for an e-visa approved for Côte d’Ivoire before you travel. <br>
You will need to apply for the e-visa online several days before your date of travel to allow time for your application to be processed. Make sure you follow instructions on the website carefully to avoid any difficulties with airlines or immigration authorities. After registering and paying online, you will be able to collect your visa on arrival at Abidjan airport. On arrival, you may be required to register your contact details before exiting the airport at the ‘Stop COVID-19’ facility. <br>
Biometric in-person visa services at the Côte d’Ivoire Embassy in London are suspended due to COVID-19. <br>
*If you’re fully vaccinated: If you’re fully vaccinated, you can enter Côte d’Ivoire without needing to test or quarantine. You no longer need to show a negative PCR test nor a Declaration of Travel by Air (DDVA), on arrival in Côte d’Ivoire as long as you can prove that you are fully vaccinated. At least 14 days must have passed since your second dose of the vaccine. <br>
COVID-19 control measures are subject to frequent review and may change at short notice. You should check the <a href=""https://deplacement-aerien.gouv.ci/#/home"">Côte d’Ivoire government’s official site </a> for updates, though these sometimes are not made immediately. <br>
Proof of vaccination status: You must present proof that you have been fully vaccinated to enter Côte d’Ivoire, if you do not have proof of a negative PCR test. <br>
Côte d’Ivoire will accept the proof of COVID-19 vaccination record. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. You should ensure you travel with your electronic vaccination certificate containing the QR code as you will be asked on arrival to show it. If possible, have a paper copy as well as an electronic copy. <br>
*If you’re not fully vaccinated: Passengers to Côte d’Ivoire who are not, or are incompletely, vaccinated will be required to present a Declaration of Travel by Air <a href=""https://deplacement-aerien.gouv.ci/#/home""> DDVA Form</a> (at a cost of 2000 XOF), accompanied by the negative PCR test (taken no more than 72 hours) before boarding your flight. 
You should arrange to take a private test. You will also need to complete the <a href=""https://deplacement-aerien.gouv.ci/#/home"">DDVA form</a> prior to arrival at a cost of 2000 XOF, available online. <br>
You will need to show this form on arrival and comply with any medical monitoring system, which has been put in place by the authorities for anyone arriving in Côte d’Ivoire from another country. <br>
As of January 2022, all inbound air travellers may be subject to additional measures to control the spread of COVID-19. For those who cannot prove that they are fully vaccinated, this includes mandatory antigen testing upon arrival at the airport. For those who are not fully vaccinated and undergo this further antigen testing on arrival at the airport, the government may monitor inbound travellers’ health status for five days by calling or texting their mobile phones. You may be monitored by SMS tracking for 14 days. <br>
*Departing Côte d’Ivoire: If you are departing Côte d’Ivoire and you are not fully vaccinated, you will need to complete a Declaration to Travel by Air <a href=https://deplacement-aerien.gouv.ci/#/home"""">DDVA Form  </a> declaring your departure and have a negative PCR test before you depart. In this case you should: complete your DDVA form, pay online for your COVID test; get tested within 72 hours of departure; and receive and download the proof of your negative test. You will need to show these documents on departure. <br>
You can make your travel declaration (your DDVA form) and pay for your COVID-19 declaration and PCR test online. You should ideally do this three or four days before your trip. It currently costs 25 000 FCFA (2000 FCFA for children under 12.) The declaration is compulsory for all passengers aged 3 and above. Children aged 12 and above will need to have a negative PCR test if they are not fully vaccinated. The <a href=""https://deplacement-aerien.gouv.ci/#/home"">Website</a> lists approved testing centres. <br>
