International Restrictions:<br> 
*All travellers: You will need a visa to enter Côte d’Ivoire as a visitor. Anyone wishing to enter Côte d’Ivoire who does not already have a visa should make their visa application through the <a href=""https://snedai.com/e-visa/"">e-visa service online </a> before travel . This is available in English. If you are not an ECOWAS national, you must hold a valid visa or have had your application for an e-visa approved for Côte d’Ivoire before you travel. <br>
You will need to apply for the e-visa online several days before your date of travel to allow time for your application to be processed. Make sure you follow instructions on the website carefully to avoid any difficulties with airlines or immigration authorities. After registering and paying online, you will be able to collect your visa on arrival at Abidjan airport. <br>

<a href=""https://deplacement-aerien.gouv.ci/#/home"">DDVA form</a> prior to arrival at a cost of 2000 XOF, available online. You will need to print a hard copy of this form. On arrival, you may be required to register your contact details before exiting the airport at the ‘Stop COVID-19’ facility. Biometric in-person visa services at the Côte d’Ivoire Embassy in London are suspended due to COVID-19. <br>
