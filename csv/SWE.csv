20220105,"COVID-19 negative certification required for entering the country.  <br>
Non-Swedish citizens entering Sweden must present a negative test conducted within 48 hours prior to their arrival regardless of whether they can present a vaccination certificate or a certificate confirming recovery from Covid-19 or not.<br>
All travelers, including those from Denmark, Finland, and Norway, are now subject to mandatory pre-entry testing regardless of their vaccination status.<br>
Foreign nationals entering Sweden from outside the EEA and outside exempt countries must be able to present a certificate at the border showing that the traveller has tested negative for COVID-19. A maximum of 48 hours may have passed between the time of testing and the border crossing. Children under 18 are exempt from the test requirement. Only the EU’s Covid Certificate of vaccination or vaccine certificates issued in a few named countries are accepted instead of a negative test. The entry restrictions will always be applied based on the last country from which you travel into Sweden, not the country of origin where the journey began. This also applies when transiting.<br>
Anyone who has been to South Africa, Lesotho, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Namibia or Eswatini (Swaziland) sometime during the last seven days before entering Sweden is requested to get tested for COVID-19 as soon as possible after entry, preferably the same day, and to take a new test after five days.

Special recommendations to those who travel from South Africa, Lesotho, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Namibia and Eswatini. Anyone who has been to South Africa, Lesotho, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Namibia or Eswatini (Swaziland) sometime during the last seven days before entering Sweden is requested to get tested for COVID-19 as soon as possible after entry, preferably the same day, and to take a new test after five days. You are also requested to stay home for seven days after arrival. The recommendation to get tested and stay home applies both to vaccinated and unvaccinated people, and to people who have had a COVID-19 infection. This also applies to those who have presented a negative test result when departing from these countries.<br>
The Public Health Agency of Sweden recommends that anyone who is 6 years of age or older, including Swedish citizens, entering Sweden from outside the Nordic countries take a PCR test after arriving in Sweden.The recommendation applies regardless of whether you have symptoms or not.  If you enter Sweden from a so-called third country, you may also need to self-isolate for seven days after your arrival. This recommendation is valid until 31 October. <br>
Exemptions to the recommendation are available here: https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/the-public-health-agency-of-sweden/communicable-disease-control/covid-19/if-you-are-planning-to-travel/recommendations-for-those-travelling/ <br> 
You should follow the the Public Health Agency of Sweden's recommendations for everyone travelling to Sweden from abroad regardless of symptoms if you are not fully vaccinated and if you are entering from a country where the Ministry of Foreign Affairs discourage from non-essential travel.","The EU Digital COVID Certificate (available as of 1 July 2021) provides proof that a person has either: <br>
been vaccinated against COVID-19 (vaccine type and manufacturer, number of doses, date of vaccination);<br>
received a negative test result, PCR or rapid antigen, with the name of the test, date and time of test, test centre and result (self-tests are not valid);<br>
recovered from COVID-19 (positive PCR test result valid for 180 days).<br>
When travelling, holders of the EU Digital COVID Certificate will have the same rights as citizens of the visited Member State who have been vaccinated, tested or recovered.<br><br>
The Swedish government has taken the next step in slowly opening up for vaccinated travelers from outside the EU. The government decided that the EU Commission's list of approved vaccine certificates – i.e. certificates that are legally treated as equivalent to the EU's own Digital Covid Certificate – will apply in Sweden, too, reports the TT news agency. This currently includes certificates issued by North Macedonia, San Marino, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine and The Vatican – but it could be extended to more countries in the future. Sweden intends to approve vaccine certificates as and when they are approved by the EU. The government's decision will come into force on September 20th.
