The Swedish government has taken the next step in slowly opening up for vaccinated travelers from outside the EU. The government decided that the EU Commission's list of approved vaccine certificates – i.e. certificates that are legally treated as equivalent to the EU's own Digital Covid Certificate – will apply in Sweden, too, reports the TT news agency. This currently includes certificates issued by North Macedonia, San Marino, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine and The Vatican – but it could be extended to more countries in the future. Sweden intends to approve vaccine certificates as and when they are approved by the EU. The government's decision will come into force on September 20th.
