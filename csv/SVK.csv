Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Public spaces and services: On 14 March, the Slovak government lifted most of the restrictions placed on public life to counter the spread of COVID-19. You should <a href=""https://korona.gov.sk/"">check the Slovak government COVID-19 website</a> (Slovak only) for the latest restrictions and exemptions as these can change at short notice. You may wish to use an online translation tool as the pages in English are not always updated regularly. There is also information on the latest measures in English on the <a href=""https://www.mic.iom.sk/en/news/637-covid-19-measures.html#curfew"">IOM Migration Information Centre</a>, <a href=""https://spectator.sme.sk/"">Slovak Spectator</a>
 and <a href=""https://enrsi.rtvs.sk/"">Radio Slovakia International</a> websites. <a href=""""></a> <br>
As of 21 April, it is only compulsory to wear facemasks when visiting healthcare facilities. Shops, restaurants, hotels and services no longer require you to show proof of vaccination, recovery or a negative COVID-19 test.<br>
*If you test positive for COVID-19: The period of self-isolation is 5 days if you test positive for COVID-19. The 5 day period begins from the day you first display symptoms or when your test was taken. You should inform anyone that you have been in close contact with during the previous 2 days. For the Slovak government’s definition of ‘close contact’, see the next section. If you display no symptoms during the final 24 hours of the 5-day quarantine period, you may end your self-isolation after the 5th day. If you continue to display symptoms, your doctor will advise when you can end your self-isolation. You should continue to wear an FFP2-standard facemask for an additional 5 days following the end of your self-isolation.<br>
