*Public spaces and services: The Slovak government has imposed restrictions on public life to counter the spread of COVID-19. You should check the Slovak government COVID-19 website (Slovak only) for the latest restrictions and exemptions as these can change at short notice. You may wish to use an online translation tool as the pages in English are not always updated regularly. There is also information on the latest measures in English on the <a href=""https://www.mic.iom.sk/en/news/637-covid-19-measures.html#curfew"">IOM Migration Information Centre</a> , <a href=""https://spectator.sme.sk/c/22790201/slovakia-enters-all-out-lockdown.html"">Slovak Spectator< /a> and <a href=""https://enrsi.rtvs.sk/articles/coronavirus/275321/slovakia-goes-into-full-lockdown-for-two-weeks"">Radio Slovakia International</a> websites. <br>
You must wear an FFP2-standard face mask in all indoor areas, including public transport and taxis; when attending indoor and outdoor events; and when outside if you are less than 2 meters away from people outside your household. <br>
Most shops, restaurants and services are open, but many require you to show that you are fully vaccinated, have received your booster, or can show a negative PCR/LAMP test result no older than 72 hours or an antigen or lateral flow test result no older than 48 hours. <br>
