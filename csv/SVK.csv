Internal Restrictions:<br> 
*Public spaces and services:  The Slovak government has imposed restrictions on public life to counter the spread of COVID-19.<br>
There are nationwide restrictions on movement outside the home. The measures and restrictions in a given district may change according to the local epidemiological situation, as set out in a framework announced by the Slovak government known as the ‘Covid Automat’. Details can be found on the <a href=""https://korona.gov.sk/koronavirus-na-slovensku-v-cislach/"">Slovak government website</a> (in Slovak only).<br>
The 20-hour daily curfew is divided into two separate phases lasting from 5am to 8pm and from 8pm to 1am the following day. Between 5am and 8pm you may only leave home for certain permitted reasons. From 8pm until 1am exemptions are reduced further and you may only leave home for certain essential purposes including travel to work, to hospital or a pharmacy, or to walk a pet. For a list of permitted activities and exemptions, some of which may require a recent negative Covid test, see the local English language media <a href=""https://spectator.sme.sk/c/22607125/government-approved-stricter-anti-pandemic-rules-if-not-effective-country-will-see-hard-lockdown.html?ref=njctse"">The Slovak Spectator</a>. The new measures are also explained in full (in Slovak only) on the <a href=""https://www.uvzsr.sk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=4512:platne-opatrenia&catid=256:uvod"">Slovak Public Health Authority website</a>.<br>
People who test positive for Covid-19 can no longer go into shops, and may only leave home to visit a doctor or a pharmacy.<br>
Travelling between districts in order to take exercise in the countryside is no longer permitted. However, inhabitants of Bratislava may travel within the Bratislava region, and inhabitants of Kosice may travel within the Kosice “okolie” districts.<br>
The authorities may stop you on main roads, at district borders and in public spaces to check whether your travel is essential.<br>
FFP2 standard facemasks, or higher, are obligatory in all shops, on public transport and in all indoor areas, apart from at home.<br>
From 20 March until at least 28 April, travel abroad for recreational purposes is prohibited, and breaches of the rule could incur a fine of up to 1000 euros. You should expect extra checks and possible delays at borders and airports when leaving Slovakia, and you may be asked to show documentary evidence that your journey is essential.<br>
