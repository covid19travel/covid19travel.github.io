Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Public spaces and services: The Slovak government has imposed restrictions on public life to counter the spread of COVID-19. There are nationwide restrictions on movement outside the home. The measures and restrictions in a given district may change according to the local epidemiological situation, as set out in a framework announced by the Slovak government known as the ‘Covid Automat’. Details can be found on the <a href=""https://korona.gov.sk/koronavirus-na-slovensku-v-cislach/"">Slovak government website</a> (in Slovak only). The 20-hour daily curfew is divided into two separate phases lasting from 5am to 8pm and from 8pm to 1am the following day. Between 5am and 8pm you may only leave home for certain permitted reasons. From 8pm until 1am exemptions are reduced further and you may only leave home for certain essential purposes including travel to work, to hospital or a pharmacy, or to walk a pet. The Slovak government announced that it will ease some restrictions from 19 April, including reopening all shops and some services, swimming pools, libraries and museums and permitting travel between districts if individuals have tested negative. Hotels may accommodate people from one household or a maximum of two adults per room, but hotel restaurants will remain closed. For a list of permitted activities and exemptions, some of which may require a recent negative COVID-19 test, see the local English language media <a href=""https://spectator.sme.sk/c/22637661/measures-will-be-lifted-from-april-19-what-will-open.html?ref=njctse"">The Slovak Spectator</a>. The new measures are also explained in full (in Slovak only) on the <a href=""https://www.uvzsr.sk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=4512:platne-opatrenia&catid=256:uvod"">Slovak Public Health Authority website</a>.<br>
From 19 April, you must still wear a facemask of FFP2 standard, or higher, inside all buildings and on public transport, but regular facemasks are acceptable in schools and outdoors. Facemasks are not obligatory outdoors if people can maintain five metres distance or they live together in one household.<br>
From 20 March until at least 28 April, travel abroad for recreational purposes is prohibited, and breaches of the rule could incur a fine of up to 1000 euros. You should expect extra checks and possible delays at borders and airports when leaving Slovakia, and you may be asked to show documentary evidence that your journey is essential.<br>
