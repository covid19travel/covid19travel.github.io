If you are not vaccinated or recovered from COVID-19 you can only enter shops selling essential items. <br>
Gatherings of more than 6 people (unless from the same household) are prohibited. <br>
Hotels and their restaurants are open for guests who can demonstrate that they are vaccinated or recovered from COVID-19.

For full details of all the restrictions, exemptions and curfew timings, you should <a href=""https://korona.gov.sk/"">check the Slovak government COVID-19 website</a> (Slovak only). You may wish to use an online translation tool as the pages in English are not updated regularly.
