<br>
Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Public spaces and services: The Slovak government has imposed restrictions on public life to counter the spread of COVID-19. You should <a href=""https://korona.gov.sk/"">check the Slovak government COVID-19 website</a> (Slovak only) for the latest restrictions and exemptions as these can change at short notice. You may wish to use an online translation tool as the pages in English are not always updated regularly. There is also information on the latest measures in English on the <a href=""https://www.mic.iom.sk/en/news/637-covid-19-measures.html#curfew"">IOM Migration Information Centre, Slovak Spectator  </a> and <a href=""https://enrsi.rtvs.sk/articles/coronavirus/275321/slovakia-goes-into-full-lockdown-for-two-weeks"">Radio Slovakia International</a> websites.
You must wear an FFP2-standard face mask in all indoor areas, including public transport and taxis; when attending indoor and outdoor events; and when outside if you are less than 2 meters away from people outside your household. <br>
Most shops, restaurants and services are open, but many require you to show that you are fully vaccinated, have received your booster, or can show a negative PCR/LAMP test result no older than 72 hours or an antigen or lateral flow test result no older than 48 hours. <br>
From 16 February, hotels require you to demonstrate that you are either fully vaccinated or have a negative PCR or LAMP test result no older than 72 hours, or a negative antigen or lateral flow test result no older than 48 hours, or proof that you have recovered from COVID-19 within the previous 180 days. For all long-distance buses and trains, you will need proof of vaccination, recovery or a negative COVID-19 test. <br>
The proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination: Slovakia will accept the proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. If you are travelling with a printed PDF proof of vaccination status, it must date from 1 November to ensure that the certificate can be scanned successfully, if domestic certification is required. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
*If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to self-isolate in your accommodation until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment. See the <a href=""https://korona.gov.sk/en/"">Slovak government COVID-19 website</a>   for advice in English on “What to do if I am COVID-19 positive”.
