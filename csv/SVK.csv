You should <a href=""https://korona.gov.sk/"">check the Slovak government COVID-19 website</a> (Slovak only) for the latest restrictions and exemptions as these can change at short notice.

There is also information on the latest measures in English on the <a href=""https://www.mic.iom.sk/en/news/637-covid-19-measures.html#curfew"">IOM Migration Information Centre, Slovak Spectator  </a>  and <a href=""https://enrsi.rtvs.sk/articles/coronavirus/275321/slovakia-goes-into-full-lockdown-for-two-weeks"">Radio Slovakia International  </a> websites.
You must wear an FFP2-standard face mask in all indoor areas, including public transport and taxis; when attending indoor and outdoor events; and when outside if you are less than 2 meters away from people outside your household. <br>
From 14 March, shops, restaurants, hotels and services no longer require you to show proof of vaccination, recovery or a negative COVID-19 test. <br>
*If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to self-isolate in your accommodation until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment. See the <a href=""https://korona.gov.sk/en/"">Slovak government COVID-19 website  </a> for advice in English on “What to do if I am COVID-19 positive”.
