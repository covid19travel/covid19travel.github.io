The test must have been taken within the 48 hours prior to departure.f you have recently recovered from COVID-19, you will still need to receive a negative PCR test result as described above before you are able to fly to South Korea. <br>
All arrivals, including children aged 5 and younger, and regardless of nationality and length of stay, are also required to be tested for coronavirus (COVID-19) within 24 hours after entering South Korea. If you are resident in South Korea, this can be at a local health centre near your residence. If you are not resident in South Korea, you will be taken for testing and must remain at the testing facility until a negative result has been secured. <br>
From April 1, if you have registered your overseas vaccination history through the <a href=""https://cov19ent.kdca.go.kr/cpassportal/biz/beffatstmnt/main.do?lang=en"">Quarantine COVID19 Defence (Q-Code) system  </a> before traveling to Korea and your PCR test following arrival is negative, you may leave the testing facility by public transport (see ‘Quarantine requirements’ below). If your test is positive, you must comply with self-quarantine and treatment instructions issued by the Korean authorities. You will be required to stay at a quarantine centre for 7 days (if you are a short-term visitor) or to isolate at home (if you are a long-term resident and if your accommodation meets certain standards). You will not need to take another PCR test at the end of your quarantine. For more information contact the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency on 1339 from inside South Korea (support is available in English). <br>
*Quarantine requirements: Starting from March 21, 2022, vaccinated travellers who have completed their COVID-19 vaccination in Korea or those who already registered their overseas vaccination history at a local Korean public health centre will be eligible for quarantine exemption. <br>
Starting from April 1, 2022, vaccinated travellers who have completed vaccination overseas and have registered their vaccination history through the <a href=""https://cov19ent.kdca.go.kr/cpassportal/biz/beffatstmnt/main.do?lang=en"">Quarantine COVID19 Defence (Q-Code) system  </a> before traveling to Korea will be eligible for quarantine exemption. <br>
Vaccination is considered to be complete 14 days after the 2nd shot for a two-dose vaccine (valid up to 180 days). In addition, vaccination is considered complete and remains valid indefinitely following booster shots. <br>
For those who have not completed vaccination or who have not registered their vaccination history through the Q-Code system, the default requirement when entering South Korea is to quarantine for seven days at home (if you are resident in South Korea) or in a government quarantine facility (if you are visiting). You can avoid quarantine entirely if you register your vaccination status through the 
<a href=""https://cov19ent.kdca.go.kr/cpassportal/biz/beffatstmnt/main.do?lang=en"">Quarantine COVID19 Defence (Q-Code) system</a> or if you have a ‘quarantine exemption’ certificate issued by a Korean embassy. 
If you’re visiting and must quarantine, you can quarantine with relatives if you can prove your relationship to them and if their accommodation meets certain standards. If you must quarantine and are a Korean national or long-term foreign resident with an Alien Registration Card and Korean residence, you may self-quarantine at home. <br>
Foreign short-term travellers who are not eligible for quarantine exemption may be able to quarantine with family members under specific circumstances. Your family member must be your spouse or a “lineal” family member (parents/grandparents or children/grandchildren, not a sibling) of you or your spouse and must be resident in Korea (i.e. a Korean national or a foreigner with a long-term stay visa). You must be able to prove your family relationship, for example by showing your ID, a copy of your family member’s Korean ID, and a marriage or birth certificate, which must be legalised (or “apostilled”). Certified translations are required for documents not in English. Your family’s accommodation must meet certain basic standards (typically, they must have a separate bedroom and a separate bathroom for you). Your family must also be available to pick you up from the airport or the quarantine facility. These rules may change at short notice – your family member in Korea should double-check the rules before you travel by calling the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency on 1339 (support is available in English). <br>
Foreign short-term travellers who are unvaccinated or who have not registered their vaccination history through the 
<a href=""https://cov19ent.kdca.go.kr/cpassportal/biz/beffatstmnt/main.do?lang=en"">Quarantine COVID19 Defence (Q-Code) system</a> must quarantine at a government-designated facility for seven days. Individuals are required to pay a daily charge of around 120,000KRW while in government quarantine facilities. <br>
*Onward travel from the airport: If you are required to quarantine or take a PCR test at a government-designated facility upon arrival, transport to the facility (usually a bus) will be provided. You will be guided to the transport by airport officials as part of your arrivals process. Once you have been released from the facility, it will then be your responsibility to secure transport to your final destination. <br>
If you are an unvaccinated, short-term visitor quarantining with family members, your family members must pick you up from the airport or from a quarantine facility later. (You will likely not be able to choose which facility you are sent to, so will not be able to pick one that is convenient for pickup.) <br>
Quarantine transport options are available from the airport for unvaccinated travellers. Guidance is available at the airport on how best to proceed to your destination. <br>
Data collection: Individuals from the UK will be tested for COVID-19 on arrival, and will need to participate with an active monitoring system via regular calls with a health expert and a specialised mobile app. <br>
Make sure you have with you a mobile telephone with the roaming function enabled, and/or the telephone number of a friend, relative or contact who can update the authorities daily on your state of health. A hotel telephone number will not be accepted. Immigration authorities will undertake a test call before travellers leave the airport, and any individual unable to verify their contact details may be denied entry to South Korea. <br>
*If you’re fully vaccinated: Quarantine exemption availability: 
Starting from March 21, 2022, vaccinated travellers who have completed their COVID-19 vaccination in Korea or those who already registered their overseas vaccination history at a local Korean public health centre will be eligible for quarantine exemption. <br>
Starting from April 1, 2022, vaccinated travellers who have completed vaccination overseas and have registered their vaccination history through the <a href=""https://cov19ent.kdca.go.kr/cpassportal/biz/beffatstmnt/main.do?lang=en"">Quarantine COVID19 Defence (Q-Code) system</a> before traveling to Korea will be eligible for quarantine exemption. <br>
Vaccination is considered to be complete 14 days after the 2nd shot for a two-dose vaccine (valid up to 180 days) or with booster shots. <br>
Entrants from Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Ukraine, and Myanmar are excluded from exemption, even if fully vaccinated. Fully vaccinated individuals may be able to apply for Quarantine Exemptions from Korean embassies in some circumstances. <br>
Re-entry permits: Fully vaccinated individuals are able to apply for special types of re-entry permit. <br>
Proof of vaccination status: You do not need to demonstrate proof of overseas vaccination in order to enter South Korea, however, if you do not register completed overseas vaccinations through the Q-Code system, you will be expected to quarantine for seven days. If you were vaccinated in South Korea, your vaccination status will be automatically linked to the Q-Code system from the COOV database. All arrivals are required to be tested. <br>
If you’re not fully vaccinated: There are no special provisions for unvaccinated individuals. Unvaccinated travellers should follow the rules for All travellers above. <br>
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year: If you have recently recovered from COVID-19, you will still need to receive a negative PCR test result before you are able to fly to South Korea. You should bring with you an official note from your doctor detailing when you tested positive, what treatment you received and/or what isolation you observed. If you test positive or inconclusive on arrival, Korean officials will consider this information when deciding how to proceed. Some foreign Nationals have tested negative in their country and then tested positive on arrival in South Korea. Korean health officials have broad discretion in deciding what precautions are required and you may be required to quarantine even if you are no longer testing positive. <br>
Otherwise, there are no special provisions for individuals who have had COVID-19 in the past year. 
Children and young people: Children aged 17 and under can follow the rules for all travellers to enter South Korea.There are some exceptions to the requirement for children to present a pre-departure PCR test on arrival. Parents should note that young children are required to take a PCR test within 24 hours of arriving in South Korea, in line with the rules for adults. <br>
From April 1, unvaccinated children aged 5 and younger do not need to quarantine if accompanied by family members who are registered through the <a href=""https://cov19ent.kdca.go.kr/cpassportal/biz/beffatstmnt/main.do?lang=en"">Quarantine COVID19 Defence (Q-Code) system</a>. Children aged 6 and older must be vaccinated and registered in the Q-Code system in order to be eligible for quarantine exemption. <br>
*If you’re transiting through South Korea: Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination. All transit passengers receive a temperature check on arrival in Korea. Symptomatic individuals will be subject to a COVID-19 test and hospitalisation if found positive. Passengers who do not show symptoms and/or test negative may continue their journey. <br>
Transit passengers at Seoul Incheon Airport require a ticket/boarding pass for their onward flight to their final destination. They should confirm with the airline(s) before departure that their bags have been checked through to their final destination (as transit passengers are not able to collect and re-check in baggage on arrival in Incheon Airport). <br>
Transit hotels are available in both Terminals 1 and 2 at Incheon Airport. A “layover” – i.e. passing through immigration to enter South Korea during a long gap between flights – is not possible in South Korea, as everyone who enters the country through immigration must proceed directly into the COVID-19 testing system and is subject, in most cases, to a seven day quarantine requirement. <br>
Exemptions: <br>
*Exemptions from pre-departure COVID-19 tests: Children aged five and under are not required to provide a negative PCR test certificate on arrival in South Korea. Individuals with quarantine exemptions issued by a Korean embassy for “humanitarian reasons” (i.e. to attend a funeral) or official business reasons are also exempt. <br>
*Quarantine exemptions: For overseas vaccinated travellers arriving in South Korea before April 1, quarantine exemptions will continue to be issued only if you are resident outside of South Korea, only for a visit lasting 14 days or less, and only for business and academic travellers, government officials, or if you are travelling to Korea for the funeral of a close family member. You can apply for a quarantine exemption via the Korean Embassy in the country where you were vaccinated. “Family member” is defined as your spouse, a sibling of you or your spouse, or a “lineal” family member (parents/grandparents or children/grandchildren) of you or your spouse. <br>
For the purposes of applying for an exemption from quarantine, the Embassy of the Republic of Korea will accept the proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination.
If you are travelling for business or academic purposes, you need to obtain special approval from the relevant Korean ministries; if you are travelling for business, your employer can apply through the <a href=""http://www.btsc.or.kr/"">Business Support Centre  </a> (in Korean). <br>
Even if you have a quarantine exemption, on arrival in Korea you will need to submit a negative PCR test taken within the 48 hours prior to your departure (with some exceptions, see the ‘Testing on arrival’ section under ‘Exemptions’ above). You will be taken to an airport testing centre for your PCR test on arrival and will not be able to leave until the result has been received. You will need to do antigen tests on days three and five and a PCR test on day seven, and comply with active health monitoring through the Korean government app. <br>
Starting from April 1, 2022, vaccinated travellers who have completed vaccination overseas and have registered their vaccination history through the <a href=""https://cov19ent.kdca.go.kr/cpassportal/biz/beffatstmnt/main.do?lang=en""> Quarantine COVID19 Defence (Q-Code) system</a> before traveling to Korea will be eligible for quarantine exemption. <br>

*Testing positive for COVID-19: If you think you might have COVID-19 while in South Korea, you should self-isolate immediately and contact the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency on 1339 for guidance (support is available in English). Outdoor sites where you can receive a free test are common in most cities. If you are eligible to receive a PCR test, you will usually receive your results via text message within 1-2 days. If you are not eligible to receive a PCR test, you will receive an antigen test which provides results within approximately 30 minutes. <br>
If you test positive for COVID-19, you must comply with self-quarantine and treatment instructions issued by the Korean authorities. The Korean authorities have made clear that if you have no or mild symptoms you will generally be eligible for quarantine and treatment at home, unless you are unable to sufficiently isolate from others. If the Korean authorities judge it necessary, you will be moved to a quarantine centre or a hospital/treatment centre. There is currently no charge for quarantine centre stays or for medical care in a hospital/treatment centre as long as you have not violated any quarantine measures. Fully vaccinated individuals will generally need to quarantine (whether at home or in a facility) for seven days. Korean health authorities generally have broad discretion to apply the rules as they see fit. You may face additional costs from your travel provider if you have to rearrange your travel. <br>
Anyone displaying symptoms or returning a positive test result for COVID-19 must comply with self-quarantine and treatment instructions issued by the Korean authorities. Failure to do so could result in imprisonment, deportation, the revocation of visas or residence permits and an entry ban, and you may be held liable for the cost of your treatment and for any economic losses incurred by further transmission of the virus. The Ministry of Justice has made clear that this policy applies to foreign residents as well as short-term visitors.
