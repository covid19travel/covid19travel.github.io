Even if you have a quarantine exemption, on arrival in Korea you will need to submit a negative PCR test taken within the 48 hours prior to your departure (with some exceptions, see ‘Testing on arrival’ above).You will also need to take PCR tests within 24 hours of your arrival and on day 10, and comply with active health monitoring through the Korean government app. <br>

International Restrictions: <br>
*Transiting in South Korea: All transit passengers receive a temperature check on arrival in Korea. Symptomatic individuals will be subject to a COVID-19 test and hospitalisation if found positive. Passengers who do not show symptoms and/or test negative may continue their journey. Transit passengers at Seoul Incheon Airport require a ticket/boarding pass for their onward flight to their final destination. They should confirm with the airline(s) before departure that their bags have been checked through to their final destination (as transit passengers are not able to collect and re-check in baggage on arrival in Incheon Airport). <br>
Transit hotels are available in both Terminals 1 and 2 at Incheon Airport.
*Testing on arrival: All foreign nationals arriving in South Korea (except children under the age of six and individuals with quarantine exemptions for “humanitarian reasons” – i.e. to attend a funeral – or official business reasons) are required to provide a negative PCR test certificate. From 20 January 2022, South Korea requires that the test must have been taken within the 48 hours prior to departure. (Prior to 20 January, the test must have been taken within the 72 hours prior to departure.) <br>
All arrivals – including children under the age of six, and regardless of nationality and length of stay – are also required to be tested for coronavirus (COVID-19) within 24 hours after entering South Korea. If you are not resident in South Korea, you will be taken for testing and must remain at the testing facility until a negative result has been secured. <br>
*Quarantine and quarantine exemptions: The default requirement when entering South Korea is to quarantine for 10 days at home (if you are resident in South Korea) or in a government quarantine facility (if you are visiting). You can avoid quarantine entirely if you have a ‘quarantine exemption’. If you’re visiting, you can quarantine with relatives if you can prove your relationship to them and if their accommodation meets certain standards. <br>
You can apply for a quarantine exemption if you have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19. The process of applying for a quarantine exemption varies depending on where you were vaccinated and the purpose of your travel. <br>
Most quarantine exemptions are currently suspended to control the spread of the omicron variant, regardless of your nationality or vaccination status. If you arrive in South Korea without a valid quarantine exemption you will need to quarantine for 10 days. <br>
Quarantine exemptions will continue to be issued only if you are resident outside of South Korea, and only for business and academic travellers, government officials, or if you are travelling to Korea for the funeral of a close family member. You can apply for a quarantine exemption via the Korean Embassy in the country where you were vaccinated. “Family member” is defined as your spouse, a sibling of you or your spouse, or a “lineal” family member (parents/grandparents or children/grandchildren) of you or your spouse. South Korea does not accept marriage certificates or civil partnership documents between same-sex partners for the purposes of applying for a quarantine exemption. If you are travelling for business or academic purposes, you need to obtain special approval from the relevant Korean ministries; if you are travelling for business, your employer can apply through the <a href=""http://www.btsc.or.kr/"">Business Support Centre  </a> (in Korean). <br>
Even if you have a quarantine exemption, on arrival in Korea you will need to submit a negative PCR test taken within the 48 hours prior to your departure (with some exceptions, see ‘Testing on arrival’ above).You will also need to take PCR tests within 24 hours of your arrival and on day 10, and comply with active health monitoring through the Korean government app. <br>
Quarantine is mandatory if you do not have a quarantine exemption. Korean nationals and long-term foreign visitors with an Alien Registration Card and Korean residence may self-quarantine at home for 10 days. <br>
Foreign short-term travellers may be able to quarantine with family members under specific circumstances. Your family member must be your spouse or a direct ascendent or descendent (a parent/grandparent or a child/grandchild, not a sibling) and must be resident in Korea (i.e. a Korean national or a foreigner with a long-term stay visa). You must be able to prove your family relationship, for example by showing your ID, a copy of your family member’s Korean ID, and a marriage or birth certificate, which must be legalised (or “apostilled”). Certified translations are required for documents not in English.) Your family’s accommodation must meet certain basic standards (typically, they must have a separate bedroom and a separate bathroom for you). Your family must also be available to pick you up from the airport or the quarantine facility. These rules may change at short notice – your family member in Korea should double-check the rules before you travel by calling the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency on 1339 (support is available in English). All other foreign short-term travellers must quarantine at a government-designated facility for 10 days. Individuals are required to pay a daily charge of around 120,000KRW while in government quarantine facilities. <br>
If you test positive for COVID-19 on arrival, you must comply with self-quarantine and treatment instructions issued by the Korean authorities. <br>
For more information contact the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency on 1339 from inside South Korea (support is available in English). <br>
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status: Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
*Data collection: Individuals from the UK will be tested for COVID-19 on arrival, and will need to participate with an active monitoring system via regular calls with a health expert and a specialised mobile app. <br>
Make sure you have with you a mobile telephone with the roaming function enabled, and/or the telephone number of a friend, relative or contact who can update the authorities daily on your state of health. A hotel telephone number will not be accepted. Immigration authorities will undertake a test call before travellers leave the airport, and any individual unable to verify their contact details may be denied entry to South Korea. <br>
During your quarantine period, the location of your mobile phone will be tracked, and you will be contacted if you leave the place where you are quarantining.<br>

Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Testing positive for COVID-19: If you think you might have COVID-19 while in South Korea, you should self-isolate immediately and contact the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency on 1339 for guidance (support is available in English). Outdoor sites where you can receive a free test are common in most cities. Results are usually issued via text message within 1-2 days. <br>
If you test positive for COVID-19, you must comply with self-quarantine and treatment instructions issued by the Korean authorities. If you have no or mild symptoms you will generally be eligible for treatment at home, unless you suffer from certain medical conditions or are unable to sufficiently isolate from others. If the Korean authorities judge it necessary, you will be moved to a quarantine centre or a hospital/treatment centre until you have received two consecutive negative tests. There is currently no charge for quarantine centre stays or for medical care in a hospital/treatment centre as long as you have not violated any quarantine measures.
Some individuals testing positive have, in the past, spent over a month in hospital/ treatment centres before testing negative and being discharged. You may face additional costs if you have to rearrange your travel. <br>
Anyone displaying symptoms or returning a positive test result for COVID-19 must comply with self-quarantine and treatment instructions issued by the Korean authorities. Failure to do so could result in imprisonment, deportation, the revocation of visas or residence permits and an entry ban, and you may be held liable for the cost of your treatment and for any economic losses incurred by further transmission of the virus. The Ministry of Justice has made clear that this policy applies to foreign residents as well as short-term visitors. <br>
*Public spaces and services: Face masks are compulsory in public places and on public transport. Failure to wear a mask can result in a fine of up to 100,000 Korean Won.<br>
