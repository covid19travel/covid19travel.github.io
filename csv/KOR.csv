International Restrictions: <br>
*All travellers: Testing on arrival: All foreign nationals arriving in South Korea are required to provide a negative PCR test certificate. The test must have been taken within the 48 hours prior to departure. You should review the detailed information on the Embassy of the Republic of Korea . If you have recently recovered from COVID-19, you will still need to receive a negative PCR test result as described above before you are able to fly to South Korea. <br>
All arrivals – including children under the age of six, and regardless of nationality and length of stay – are also required to be tested for coronavirus (COVID-19) within 24 hours after entering South Korea. If you are resident in South Korea, this can be at a local health centre near your residence. If you are not resident in South Korea, you will be taken for testing and must remain at the testing facility until a negative result has been secured. <br>
If your test on arrival is negative, you can proceed onto quarantine (see ‘Quarantine requirements’ below). If your test is positive, you must comply with self-quarantine and treatment instructions issued by the Korean authorities. You will be required to stay at a quarantine centre for 7 days (if you are a short-term visitor) or to isolate at home (if you are a long-term resident and if your accommodation meets certain standards). You will not need to take another PCR test at the end of your quarantine. For more information contact the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency on 1339 from inside South Korea (support is available in English). <br>
*Quarantine requirements: The default requirement when entering South Korea is to quarantine for seven days at home (if you are resident in South Korea) or in a government quarantine facility (if you are visiting). You can avoid quarantine entirely if you have a ‘quarantine exemption’. Regardless of where you are quarantining or if you have a quarantine exemption, you must take a PCR test on day seven. If you’re visiting, you can quarantine with relatives if you can prove your relationship to them and if their accommodation meets certain standards. <br>
Korean nationals and long-term foreign visitors with an Alien Registration Card and Korean residence may self-quarantine at home for seven days. <br>
Foreign short-term travellers may be able to quarantine with family members under specific circumstances. Your family member must be your spouse or a “lineal” family member (parents/grandparents or children/grandchildren, not a sibling) of you or your spouse and must be resident in Korea (i.e. a Korean national or a foreigner with a long-term stay visa). You must be able to prove your family relationship, for example by showing your ID, a copy of your family member’s Korean ID, and a marriage or birth certificate, which must be legalised (or “apostilled”). Certified translations are required for documents not in English. Your family’s accommodation must meet certain basic standards (typically, they must have a separate bedroom and a separate bathroom for you). Your family must also be available to pick you up from the airport or the quarantine facility. These rules may change at short notice – your family member in Korea should double-check the rules before you travel by calling the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency on 1339 (support is available in English).< br>
All other foreign short-term travellers must quarantine at a government-designated facility for seven days. Individuals are required to pay a daily charge of around 120,000KRW while in government quarantine facilities. <br>
*Onward travel from the airport: If you are required to quarantine at a government-designated facility, transport to the facility (usually a bus) will be provided. You will be guided to the transport by airport officials as part of your arrivals process. <br>
If you are a short-term visitor quarantining with family members, your family members must pick you up from the airport or from a quarantine facility later. (You will likely not be able to choose which facility you are sent to, so will not be able to pick one that is convenient for pickup.) . If you are resident in Korea and able to quarantine at home, you will be expected to make your way home using either your own car or quarantine transport options (see below). <br>
If you have a quarantine exemption, you are also required to use quarantine transport to proceed from the airport to the location where you will be staying. <br>
Quarantine transport options are available from the airport. Quarantine taxis can take you door-to-door. Quarantine buses run from the airport to locations around Seoul, from which you can take a quarantine taxi to your final destination. There are also quarantine KTX (bullet train) options if you live outside of Seoul; a quarantine bus will take you from the airport to Gwangmyeong KTX station. Once you reach your destination KTX station, you will be assisted to take a quarantine taxi to your final destination. Guidance is available at the airport on how best to proceed to your destination. <br>
*Data collection: Individuals will be tested for COVID-19 on arrival, and will need to participate with an active monitoring system via regular calls with a health expert and a specialised mobile app. <br>
Make sure you have with you a mobile telephone with the roaming function enabled, and/or the telephone number of a friend, relative or contact who can update the authorities daily on your state of health. A hotel telephone number will not be accepted. Immigration authorities will undertake a test call before travellers leave the airport, and any individual unable to verify their contact details may be denied entry to South Korea.
During your quarantine period, the location of your mobile phone will be tracked, and you will be contacted if you leave the place where you are quarantining.
*If you’re fully vaccinated: Quarantine exemption availability: Fully vaccinated individuals are able to apply for Quarantine Exemptions in some circumstances. <br>
*Re-entry permits: Fully vaccinated individuals are able to apply for special types of re-entry permit. <br>
*Proof of vaccination status: You do not need to demonstrate proof of overseas vaccination when entering South Korea. If you were vaccinated in South Korea, you will be asked to demonstrate your vaccination status using the COOV app or alternative paper certificate. All arrivals are required to be tested and are subject to quarantine (unless you have a quarantine exemption. <br>
*If you’re not fully vaccinated: There are no special provisions for unvaccinated individuals. Unvaccinated travellers should follow the rules for ‘All travellers’ above.<br>
*If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year: If you have recently recovered from COVID-19, you will still need to receive a negative PCR test result, above before you are able to fly to South Korea. You should bring with you an official note from your doctor detailing when you tested positive, what treatment you received and/or what isolation you observed. If you test positive or inconclusive on arrival, Korean officials will consider this information when deciding how to proceed. Some foreign nationals have tested negative in the and then tested positive on arrival in South Korea. Korean health officials have broad discretion in deciding what precautions are required and you may be required to quarantine even if you are no longer testing positive. <br>
Otherwise, there are no special provisions for individuals who have had COVID-19 in the past year. You should follow the rules for All travellers above. <br>
*Children and young people: Children aged 17 and under can follow the rules for All travellers to enter South Korea. There are some exceptions to the requirement for children to present a pre-departure PCR test on arrival. Parents should note that young children are required to take a PCR test within 24 hours of arriving in South Korea, in line with the rules for adults. Some children are eligible for quarantine exemptions under certain circumstances. <br> 
*If you’re transiting through South Korea: Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination. <br>
All transit passengers receive a temperature check on arrival in Korea. Symptomatic individuals will be subject to a COVID-19 test and hospitalisation if found positive. Passengers who do not show symptoms and/or test negative may continue their journey. <br>
Transit passengers at Seoul Incheon Airport require a ticket/boarding pass for their onward flight to their final destination. They should confirm with the airline(s) before departure that their bags have been checked through to their final destination (as transit passengers are not able to collect and re-check in baggage on arrival in Incheon Airport). <br>
Transit hotels are available in both Terminals 1 and 2 at Incheon Airport. A “layover” – i.e. passing through immigration to enter South Korea during a long gap between flights – is not possible in South Korea, as everyone who enters the country through immigration must proceed directly into the COVID-19 testing system and is subject, in most cases, to a seven day quarantine requirement. <br>
*Exemptions: Exemptions from pre-departure COVID-19 tests
Children aged five and under are not required to provide a negative PCR test certificate on arrival in South Korea. Individuals with quarantine exemptions for “humanitarian reasons” (i.e. to attend a funeral) or official business reasons are also exempt. <br>
*Quarantine exemptions: You can apply for a quarantine exemption if you have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19. The process of applying for a quarantine exemption varies depending on where you were vaccinated and the purpose of your travel. <br>
Most quarantine exemptions are currently suspended to control the spread of the omicron variant, regardless of your nationality or vaccination status. If you arrive in South Korea without a valid quarantine exemption you will need to quarantine for seven days. <br>
Quarantine exemptions will continue to be issued only if you are resident outside of South Korea, only for a visit lasting 14 days or less, and only for business and academic travellers, government officials, or if you are travelling to Korea for the funeral of a close family member. You can apply for a quarantine exemption via the Korean Embassy in the country where you were vaccinated. “Family member” is defined as your spouse, a sibling of you or your spouse, or a “lineal” family member (parents/grandparents or children/grandchildren) of you or your spouse. <br>
Children aged five and under who are travelling with their parents are eligible for a quarantine exemption as long as their parents are also eligible and the application is made at the same time. Unvaccinated children from age 6 to age 17 are not eligible for a quarantine exemption. <br>
For the purposes of applying for an exemption from quarantine, the Embassies of the Republic of Korea  will accept the proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
Any family relationship certificates (i.e. marriage or birth certificates) that you submit as part of your application need to be legalised (or “apostilled”) by the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office before you submit them. South Korea does not accept marriage certificates or civil partnership documents between same-sex partners for the purposes of applying for a quarantine exemption. <br>
If you are travelling for business or academic purposes, you need to obtain special approval from the relevant Korean ministries; if you are travelling for business, your employer can apply through the <a href=""http://www.btsc.or.kr/"">Business Support Centre  </a> (in Korean). <br>
Even if you have a quarantine exemption, on arrival in Korea you will need to submit a negative PCR test taken within the 48 hours prior to your departure (with some exceptions, see the ‘Testing on arrival’ section under ‘Exemptions’ above). You will be taken to an airport testing centre for your PCR test on arrival and will not be able to leave until the result has been received. You will need to do antigen tests on days three and five and a PCR test on day seven, and comply with active health monitoring through the Korean government app.
*Onward travel from the airport: If you are a short-term visitor with a quarantine exemption, you will need to proceed from the airport to the location where you will be staying using quarantine transport. <br>
  <br>
  <br>
Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Testing positive for COVID-19: If you think you might have COVID-19 while in South Korea, you should self-isolate immediately and contact the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency on 1339 for guidance (support is available in English). Outdoor sites where you can receive a free test are common in most cities. If you are eligible to receive a PCR test, you will usually receive your results via text message within 1-2 days. If you are not eligible to receive a PCR test, you will receive an antigen test which provides results within approximately 30 minutes. <br>
If you test positive for COVID-19, you must comply with self-quarantine and treatment instructions issued by the Korean authorities. The Korean authorities have made clear that if you have no or mild symptoms you will generally be eligible for quarantine and treatment at home, unless you are unable to sufficiently isolate from others. If the Korean authorities judge it necessary, you will be moved to a quarantine centre or a hospital/treatment centre. There is currently no charge for quarantine centre stays or for medical care in a hospital/treatment centre as long as you have not violated any quarantine measures. Fully vaccinated individuals will generally need to quarantine (whether at home or in a facility) for seven days. Korean health authorities generally have broad discretion to apply the rules as they see fit. You may face additional costs from your travel provider if you have to rearrange your travel. <br>
Anyone displaying symptoms or returning a positive test result for COVID-19 must comply with self-quarantine and treatment instructions issued by the Korean authorities. Failure to do so could result in imprisonment, deportation, the revocation of visas or residence permits and an entry ban, and you may be held liable for the cost of your treatment and for any economic losses incurred by further transmission of the virus. The Ministry of Justice has made clear that this policy applies to foreign residents as well as short-term visitors. <br>
*Public spaces and services: Face masks are compulsory in public places and on public transport. Failure to wear a mask can result in a fine of up to 100,000 Korean. <br>
