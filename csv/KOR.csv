International Restrictions: <br>
*All travellers: Testing on arrival: All foreign nationals arriving in South Korea are required to provide a negative PCR test certificate. The PCR test (RT-PCR, LAMP, TMA, SDA, and NEAR DNA amplification-based tests are also valid) must have been taken within the 48 hours prior to departure. As of 23 May 2022, a supervised Rapid Antigen Test (RAT, i.e. lateral flow test) issued by a hospital or clinic within 24 hours prior to departure will also be accepted. If you have recently recovered from COVID-19 in Korea, you may upload a certificate of recovery rather than a negative PCR result into the Q-Code system prior to departure. For all other foreign travellers, it is required to receive a negative PCR/supervised RAT test result as described above before you are able to fly to South Korea. <br>
All arrivals, including children aged 5 and younger, and regardless of nationality and length of stay, are also required to be tested for coronavirus (COVID-19) within 72 hours after entering South Korea. You can reserve an appointment for a PCR test upon arrival at Incheon Airport through the  <a href=""https://www.airport.kr/ap_cnt/en/svc/covid19/medical/medical.do"">Airport Clinic’s website </a>   or take a PCR test within 72 hours of arrival in South Korea at a medical institution near your accommodation or residence. Foreign short-term travellers must pay for a PCR test at either the Airport Clinic or a medical institution while Korean citizens and long-term visa-holders may visit a local public health centre to take a PCR test for free within 72 hours of arrival. <br>
If you have registered your overseas vaccination history through the  <a href=""https://cov19ent.kdca.go.kr/cpassportal/biz/beffatstmnt/main.do?lang=en"">Quarantine COVID19 Defence (Q-Code) system</a> before traveling to Korea, you may proceed to your final destination by public transport and take a PCR test within 72 hours (see ‘Quarantine requirements’ below). If your test is positive, you must comply with self-quarantine and treatment instructions issued by the Korean authorities. You will be required to stay at a quarantine centre for 7 days (if you are a short-term visitor) or to isolate at home (if you are a long-term resident and if your accommodation meets certain standards). You will not need to take another PCR test at the end of your quarantine. For more information contact the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency on 1339 from inside South Korea (support is available in English). <br>
*Quarantine requirements: Vaccinated travellers who have completed their COVID-19 vaccination in Korea or have completed vaccination overseas and have registered their vaccination history through the  <a href=""https://cov19ent.kdca.go.kr/cpassportal/biz/beffatstmnt/main.do?lang=en"">Quarantine COVID19 Defence (Q-Code) system</a> before traveling to Korea will be eligible for quarantine exemption. Vaccination is considered to be complete and remains valid indefinitely 14 days after the 2nd shot for a two-dose vaccine. <br>
For those who have not completed vaccination or who have not registered their vaccination history through the Q-Code system, the default requirement when entering South Korea is to quarantine for seven days at home (if you are resident in South Korea) or in a government quarantine facility (if you are visiting). You can avoid quarantine entirely if you register your vaccination status through the  <a href=""https://cov19ent.kdca.go.kr/cpassportal/biz/beffatstmnt/main.do?lang=en"">Quarantine COVID19 Defence (Q-Code) system</a> or if you have a ‘quarantine exemption’ certificate issued by a Korean embassy. <br>
If you’re visiting and must quarantine, you can quarantine with relatives if you can prove your relationship to them and if their accommodation meets certain standards. If you must quarantine and are a Korean national or long-term foreign resident with an Alien Registration Card and Korean residence, you may self-quarantine at home. <br>
Foreign short-term travellers who are not eligible for quarantine exemption may be able to quarantine with family members under specific circumstances. Your family member must be your spouse or a “lineal” family member (parents/grandparents or children/grandchildren, not a sibling) of you or your spouse and must be resident in Korea (i.e. a Korean national or a foreigner with a long-term stay visa). You must be able to prove your family relationship, for example by showing your ID, a copy of your family member’s Korean ID, and a marriage or birth certificate, which must be legalised (or “apostilled”). Certified translations are required for documents not in English. Your family’s accommodation must meet certain basic standards (typically, they must have a separate bedroom and a separate bathroom for you). Your family must also be available to pick you up from the airport or the quarantine facility. These rules may change at short notice – your family member in Korea should double-check the rules before you travel by calling the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency on 1339 (support is available in English). <br>
Foreign short-term travellers who are unvaccinated or who have not registered their vaccination history through the <a href=""https://cov19ent.kdca.go.kr/cpassportal/biz/beffatstmnt/main.do?lang=en"">Quarantine COVID19 Defence (Q-Code) system</a> must quarantine at a government-designated facility for seven days. Individuals are required to pay a daily charge of around 120,000KRW while in government quarantine facilities. <br>
Onward travel from the airport: If you are an unvaccinated, short-term visitor quarantining with family members, your family members must pick you up from the airport or from a quarantine facility later. <br>
Quarantine transport options are available from the airport for unvaccinated travellers. Guidance is available at the airport on how best to proceed to your destination. Vaccinated travellers may proceed to their final destination by public transport. <br>
Data collection: Individuals will be tested for COVID-19 on arrival, and will need to participate with an active monitoring system via regular calls with a health expert and a specialised mobile app. <br>
Make sure you have with you a mobile telephone with the roaming function enabled, and/or the telephone number of a friend, relative or contact who can update the authorities daily on your state of health. A hotel telephone number will not be accepted. Immigration authorities will undertake a test call before travellers leave the airport, and any individual unable to verify their contact details may be denied entry to South Korea. <br>
*If you’re fully vaccinated: Quarantine exemption availability: Vaccinated travellers who have completed their COVID-19 vaccination in Korea or have completed vaccination overseas and have registered their vaccination history through the <a href=""https://cov19ent.kdca.go.kr/cpassportal/biz/beffatstmnt/main.do?lang=en"">Quarantine COVID19 Defence (Q-Code) system</a> before traveling to Korea will be eligible for quarantine exemption. Vaccination is considered to be complete and remains valid indefinitely 14 days after the 2nd shot for a two-dose vaccine. <br>
Entrants from certain countries may be excluded from exemption, even if fully vaccinated. Check the <a href=""http://ncov.mohw.go.kr/en/tcmBoardList.do?brdId=12&brdGubun=125&dataGubun=&ncvContSeq=&contSeq=&board_id="">Ministry of Health and Welfare’s website  </a> for further details. <br>
Unvaccinated individuals may be able to apply for Quarantine Exemptions from Korean embassies in some circumstances.
Proof of vaccination status: You do not need to demonstrate proof of overseas vaccination in order to enter South Korea, however, if you do not register completed overseas vaccinations through the Q-Code system, you will be expected to quarantine for seven days. If you were vaccinated in South Korea, your vaccination status will be automatically linked to the Q-Code system from the COOV database. All arrivals are required to be tested. <br>
*If you’re not fully vaccinated: There are no special provisions for unvaccinated individuals. If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year: If you have recently recovered from COVID-19, you will still need to receive a negative PCR or supervised RAT (lateral flow test) result. You should bring with you an official note from your doctor detailing when you tested positive, what treatment you received and/or what isolation you observed. If you test positive or inconclusive on arrival, Korean officials will consider this information when deciding how to proceed. Some Foreign Nationals have tested negative in their country and then tested positive on arrival in South Korea. Korean health officials have broad discretion in deciding what precautions are required and you may be required to quarantine even if you are no longer testing positive. Otherwise, there are no special provisions for individuals who have had COVID-19 in the past year. <br>
*Children and young people: Children aged 17 and under can follow the rules for All travellers’ to enter South Korea.
There are some exceptions to the requirement for children to present a pre-departure PCR test on arrival. Parents should note that young children are required to take a PCR test within 72 hours of arriving in South Korea, in line with the rules for adults. <br>
Unvaccinated children aged 11 and younger do not need to quarantine if accompanied by family members whose vaccinations are registered through the <a href=""https://cov19ent.kdca.go.kr/cpassportal/biz/beffatstmnt/main.do?lang=en"">Quarantine COVID19 Defence (Q-Code) system</a>.
*If you’re transiting through South Korea: Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination. <br>
All transit passengers receive a temperature check on arrival in Korea. Symptomatic individuals will be subject to a COVID-19 test and hospitalisation if found positive. Passengers who do not show symptoms and/or test negative may continue their journey. <br>
Transit passengers at Seoul Incheon Airport require a ticket/boarding pass for their onward flight to their final destination. They should confirm with the airline(s) before departure that their bags have been checked through to their final destination (as transit passengers are not able to collect and re-check in baggage on arrival in Incheon Airport). <br>
Transit hotels are available in both Terminals 1 and 2 at Incheon Airport. A “layover” – i.e. passing through immigration to enter South Korea during a long gap between flights – is not possible in South Korea, as everyone who enters the country through immigration must proceed directly into the COVID-19 testing system and is subject, in most cases, to a seven day quarantine requirement. <br>
*Exemptions from pre-departure COVID-19 tests: Children aged five and under are not required to provide a negative PCR test certificate on arrival in South Korea. Individuals with quarantine exemptions issued by a Korean embassy for “humanitarian reasons” (i.e. to attend a funeral) or official business reasons are also exempt. <br>
*Quarantine exemptions: For overseas unvaccinated travellers arriving in South Korea, quarantine exemptions will be issued from Korean embassies only for attendance at the funeral of a close family member. You can apply for a quarantine exemption via the Korean Embassy in the country where you are resident. “Family member” is defined as your spouse, a sibling of you or your spouse, or a “lineal” family member (parents/grandparents or children/grandchildren) of you or your spouse. <br>
If you are unvaccinated and are travelling to Korea for business, your employer can apply for a Quarantine Exemption Certificate through the <a href=""http://www.btsc.or.kr/"">Business Support Centre</a> (in Korean). <br>
Vaccinated travellers who have completed vaccination overseas and have registered their vaccination history through the 
<a href=""https://cov19ent.kdca.go.kr/cpassportal/biz/beffatstmnt/main.do?lang=en"">Quarantine COVID19 Defence (Q-Code) system</a> before traveling to Korea will be eligible for quarantine exemption.<br>
  <br>
  <br>

*Testing positive for COVID-19: If you think you might have COVID-19 while in South Korea, you should self-isolate immediately and contact the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency on 1339 for guidance (support is available in English). Outdoor sites where you can receive a free test are common in most cities. If you are eligible to receive a PCR test, you will usually receive your results via text message within 1-2 days. If you are not eligible to receive a PCR test, you will receive an antigen test which provides results within approximately 30 minutes. <br>
If you test positive for COVID-19, you must comply with self-quarantine and treatment instructions issued by the Korean authorities. The Korean authorities have made clear that if you have no or mild symptoms you will generally be eligible for quarantine and treatment at home, unless you are unable to sufficiently isolate from others. If the Korean authorities judge it necessary, you will be moved to a quarantine centre or a hospital/treatment centre. There is currently no charge for quarantine centre stays or for medical care in a hospital/treatment centre as long as you have not violated any quarantine measures. Fully vaccinated individuals will generally need to quarantine (whether at home or in a facility) for seven days. Korean health authorities generally have broad discretion to apply the rules as they see fit. You may face additional costs from your travel provider if you have to rearrange your travel. <br>
Anyone displaying symptoms or returning a positive test result for COVID-19 must comply with self-quarantine and treatment instructions issued by the Korean authorities. Failure to do so could result in imprisonment, deportation, the revocation of visas or residence permits and an entry ban, and you may be held liable for the cost of your treatment and for any economic losses incurred by further transmission of the virus. The Ministry of Justice has made clear that this policy applies to foreign residents as well as short-term visitors.
