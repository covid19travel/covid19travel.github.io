International Restrictions: <br>
*Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19): Transiting in South Korea: All transit passengers receive a temperature check on arrival in Korea. Symptomatic individuals will be subject to a COVID-19 test and hospitalisation if found positive. Passengers who do not show symptoms and/or test negative may continue their journey. Transit passengers at Seoul Incheon Airport require a ticket/boarding pass for their onward flight to their final destination. They should confirm with the airline(s) before departure that their bags have been checked through to their final destination (as transit passengers are not able to collect and re-check in baggage on arrival in Incheon Airport). Transit hotels are available in both Terminals 1 and 2 at Incheon Airport. <br>
-Testing / screening on arrival: All foreign nationals arriving in South Korea are required to provide a negative PCR test declaration, issued within 72 hours prior to departure. More details can be found on the website of your local South Korean Embassy. All arrivals – regardless of nationality and length of stay – are also required to be tested for coronavirus (COVID-19) after entering South Korea. If you are not resident in South Korea, you will be taken for testing and must remain at the testing facility until a negative result has been secured. If you have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, you can apply for a ‘quarantine exemption’ which allows you to bypass quarantine when entering South Korea.

If you have a Korean government-approved official vaccination certificate showing that you had received two vaccine doses in South Korea more than 14 days before you departed from South Korea, you may be exempted from compulsory quarantine on your return. If you were only partially vaccinated in South Korea – for example, if you received one dose in South Korea and a second in the UK – you will not be eligible for this exemption. Arrivals from certain countries are not eligible for this exemption – if you are resident in South Korea, you should check with the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency by calling 1339 (support is available in English) before you travel. <br>
If you were vaccinated outside of South Korea and are travelling for “humanitarian” purposes, you can apply for a quarantine exemption via the Korean Embassy in the country where you were vaccinated. “Humanitarian” purposes is defined as attending a funeral or visiting “lineal” family members – parents/grandparents or children/grandchildren, but not siblings.

If you are travelling for business or academic purposes, you need to obtain special approval from the relevant Korean ministries; if you are travelling for business, your employer can apply through the <a href=""http://www.btsc.or.kr/"">Business Support Centre</a> (in Korean). <br>
Even if you have a quarantine exemption, on arrival in Korea you will need to submit a negative PCR test issued within 72 hours prior to departure. You will also need to take PCR tests on arrival and on day 6 or 7, and comply with active health monitoring through the Korean government app. <br>
