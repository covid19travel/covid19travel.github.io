LAMP tests are accepted. The test must have been taken within the 48 hours prior to departure. <br>
All arrivals – including children under the age of six, and regardless of nationality and length of stay – are also required to be tested for coronavirus (COVID-19) within 24 hours after entering South Korea. If you are not resident in South Korea, you will be taken for testing and must remain at the testing facility until a negative result has been secured.<br>
If you have recently recovered from COVID-19, you will still need to receive a negative PCR test result <br>","Quarantine requirement at government designated site- subject to vaccine satus. <br>
All transit passengers receive a temperature check on arrival in Korea. Symptomatic individuals will be subject to a COVID-19 test and hospitalisation if found positive. <br>
All other foreign short-term travellers must quarantine at a government-designated facility for seven days. Individuals are required to pay a daily charge of around 120,000KRW (approximately £75) while in government quarantine facilities.<br>
The default requirement when entering South Korea is to quarantine for seven days at home (if you are resident in South Korea) or in a government quarantine facility (if you are visiting). You can avoid quarantine entirely if you have a ‘quarantine exemption’. If you’re visiting, you can quarantine with relatives if you can prove your relationship to them and if their accommodation meets certain standards. 
You can apply for a quarantine exemption if you have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19.<br>
Most quarantine exemptions are currently suspended to control the spread of the omicron variant, regardless of your nationality or vaccination status. If you arrive in South Korea without a valid quarantine exemption you will need to quarantine for seven days.<br>
Quarantine exemptions will continue to be issued only if you are resident outside of South Korea, only for a visit lasting 14 days or less, and only for business and academic travellers, government officials, or if you are travelling to Korea for the funeral of a close family member. You can apply for a quarantine exemption via the Korean Embassy in the country where you were vaccinated.","

From 1 July, vaccinated individuals, including those who received their vaccinations outside of South Korea, will be eligible for quarantine exemptions if they are travelling for business, academic, or humanitarian purposes. “Humanitarian purposes” includes funeral attendance and visiting family (i.e. parents, spouse’s parents, spouse or children). Exemptions will not be available if you are travelling from South Africa, Malawi, Botswana, Mozambique, Tanzania, Eswatini, Zimbabwe, Bangladesh, Equatorial Guinea, Brazil, Suriname, Paraguay or Chile. To be eligible individuals must be fully vaccinated 2 weeks before entering Korea, and must have received a vaccine authorised for emergency use by the WHO.","Latest News:

International Restrictions: <br>
*Transiting in South Korea: All transit passengers receive a temperature check on arrival in Korea. Symptomatic individuals will be subject to a COVID-19 test and hospitalisation if found positive. Passengers who do not show symptoms and/or test negative may continue their journey. Transit passengers at Seoul Incheon Airport require a ticket/boarding pass for their onward flight to their final destination. They should confirm with the airline(s) before departure that their bags have been checked through to their final destination (as transit passengers are not able to collect and re-check in baggage on arrival in Incheon Airport). Transit hotels are available in both Terminals 1 and 2 at Incheon Airport. <br>
*Testing on arrival: All foreign nationals arriving in South Korea (except children under the age of six and individuals with quarantine exemptions for “humanitarian reasons” – i.e. to attend a funeral – or official business reasons) are required to provide a negative PCR test certificate. LAMP tests are accepted. The test must have been taken within the 48 hours prior to departure. <br>
All arrivals – including children under the age of six, and regardless of nationality and length of stay – are also required to be tested for coronavirus (COVID-19) within 24 hours after entering South Korea. If you are not resident in South Korea, you will be taken for testing and must remain at the testing facility until a negative result has been secured. <br>
If you have recently recovered from COVID-19, you will still need to receive a negative PCR test result as described above before you are able to fly to South Korea. You should bring with you an official note from your doctor detailing when you tested positive, what treatment you received and/or what isolation you observed. If you test positive or inconclusive on arrival, Korean officials will consider this information when deciding how to proceed. Some British Nationals have tested negative in the UK and then tested positive on arrival in South Korea. Korean health officials have broad discretion in deciding what precautions are required and you may be required to quarantine even if you are no longer testing positive. <br>
*Quarantine and quarantine exemptions: The default requirement when entering South Korea is to quarantine for seven days at home (if you are resident in South Korea) or in a government quarantine facility (if you are visiting). You can avoid quarantine entirely if you have a ‘quarantine exemption’. If you’re visiting, you can quarantine with relatives if you can prove your relationship to them and if their accommodation meets certain standards. <br>
You can apply for a quarantine exemption if you have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19. The process of applying for a quarantine exemption varies depending on where you were vaccinated and the purpose of your travel. <br>
Most quarantine exemptions are currently suspended to control the spread of the omicron variant, regardless of your nationality or vaccination status. If you arrive in South Korea without a valid quarantine exemption you will need to quarantine for seven days. <br>
Quarantine exemptions will continue to be issued only if you are resident outside of South Korea, only for a visit lasting 14 days or less, and only for business and academic travellers, government officials, or if you are travelling to Korea for the funeral of a close family member. You can apply for a quarantine exemption via the Korean Embassy in the country where you were vaccinated. “Family member” is defined as your spouse, a sibling of you or your spouse, or a “lineal” family member (parents/grandparents or children/grandchildren) of you or your spouse. South Korea does not accept marriage certificates or civil partnership documents between same-sex partners for the purposes of applying for a quarantine exemption. If you are travelling for business or academic purposes, you need to obtain special approval from the relevant Korean ministries; if you are travelling for business, your employer can apply through the<a href=""http://www.btsc.or.kr/""> Business Support Centre</a> (in Korean). <br>
Even if you have a quarantine exemption, on arrival in Korea you will need to submit a negative PCR test taken within the 48 hours prior to your departure (with some exceptions, see ‘Testing on arrival’ above). You will be taken to an airport testing centre for your PCR test on arrival and will not be able to leave until the result has been received. You will need to do antigen tests on days three and five and a PCR test on day seven, and comply with active health monitoring through the Korean government app. <br>
Quarantine is mandatory if you do not have a quarantine exemption. Korean nationals and long-term foreign visitors with an Alien Registration Card and Korean residence may self-quarantine at home for seven days. <br>
Foreign short-term travellers may be able to quarantine with family members under specific circumstances. Your family member must be your spouse or a direct ascendent or descendent (a parent/grandparent or a child/grandchild, not a sibling) and must be resident in Korea (i.e. a Korean national or a foreigner with a long-term stay visa). You must be able to prove your family relationship, for example by showing your ID, a copy of your family member’s Korean ID, and a marriage or birth certificate, which must be legalised (or “apostilled”). Certified translations are required for documents not in English.) Your family’s accommodation must meet certain basic standards (typically, they must have a separate bedroom and a separate bathroom for you). Your family must also be available to pick you up from the airport or the quarantine facility. These rules may change at short notice – your family member in Korea should double-check the rules before you travel by calling the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency on 1339 (support is available in English). <br>
All other foreign short-term travellers must quarantine at a government-designated facility for seven days. Individuals are required to pay a daily charge of around 120,000KRW while in government quarantine facilities. <br>
If you test positive for COVID-19 on arrival, you must comply with self-quarantine and treatment instructions issued by the Korean authorities. See For more information contact the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency on 1339 from inside South Korea (support is available in English). <br>
*Onward travel from the airport: If you are required to quarantine at a government-designated facility, transport to the facility (usually a bus) will be provided. You will be guided to the transport by airport officials as part of your arrivals process. If you are a short-term visitor quarantining with family members, your family members must pick you up from the airport or from a quarantine facility later. (You will likely not be able to choose which facility you are sent to, so will not be able to pick one that is convenient for pickup.) If you are a short-term visitor with a quarantine exemption, you will need to proceed from the airport to the location where you will be staying using quarantine transport (see below). If you are resident in Korea and able to quarantine at home, you will be expected to make your way home using either your own car or quarantine transport options (see below). Quarantine transport options are available from the airport. Quarantine taxis can take you door-to-door. Quarantine buses run from the airport to locations around Seoul, from which you can take a quarantine taxi to your final destination. There are also quarantine KTX (bullet train) options if you live outside of Seoul; a quarantine bus will take you from the airport to Gwangmyeong KTX station. Once you reach your destination KTX station, you will be assisted to take a quarantine taxi to your final destination. Guidance is available at the airport on how best to proceed to your destination. <br>
*Demonstrating your COVID-19 status: For the purposes of applying for an exemption from quarantine, the Embassy of the Republic of Korea in London will accept the proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
*Data collection: All arrivals will be tested for COVID-19 on arrival, and will need to participate with an active monitoring system via regular calls with a health expert and a specialised mobile app. <br>
Make sure you have with you a mobile telephone with the roaming function enabled, and/or the telephone number of a friend, relative or contact who can update the authorities daily on your state of health. A hotel telephone number will not be accepted. Immigration authorities will undertake a test call before travellers leave the airport, and any individual unable to verify their contact details may be denied entry to South Korea. <br>
During your quarantine period, the location of your mobile phone will be tracked, and you will be contacted if you leave the place where you are quarantining.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Testing positive for COVID-19: If you think you might have COVID-19 while in South Korea, you should self-isolate immediately and contact the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency on 1339 for guidance (support is available in English). Outdoor sites where you can receive a free test are common in most cities. If you are eligible to receive a PCR test, you will usually receive your results via text message within 1-2 days. If you are not eligible to receive a PCR test, you will receive an antigen test which provides results within approximately 30 minutes. <br>
If you test positive for COVID-19, you must comply with self-quarantine and treatment instructions issued by the Korean authorities. If you have no or mild symptoms you will generally be eligible for quarantine and treatment at home, unless you suffer from certain medical conditions or are unable to sufficiently isolate from others. If the Korean authorities judge it necessary, you will be moved to a quarantine centre or a hospital/treatment centre. There is currently no charge for quarantine centre stays or for medical care in a hospital/treatment centre as long as you have not violated any quarantine measures. <br>
Fully vaccinated individuals will generally need to quarantine (whether at home or in a facility) for seven days. However, some individuals testing positive have, in the past, spent over a month in hospital/ treatment centres before testing negative and being discharged. Korean health authorities generally have broad discretion to apply the rules as they see fit. You may face additional costs from your travel provider if you have to rearrange your travel. <br>
Anyone displaying symptoms or returning a positive test result for COVID-19 must comply with self-quarantine and treatment instructions issued by the Korean authorities. Failure to do so could result in imprisonment, deportation, the revocation of visas or residence permits and an entry ban, and you may be held liable for the cost of your treatment and for any economic losses incurred by further transmission of the virus. The Ministry of Justice has made clear that this policy applies to foreign residents as well as short-term visitors. <br>
*Public spaces and services: Face masks are compulsory in public places and on public transport. Failure to wear a mask can result in a fine of up to 100,000 Korean. <br>
