International Restrictions: <br>
*All travellers: Covid-19 Testing and Q-Code: On arrival in South Korea, you need to submit a questionnaire on your health condition. The South Korean government encourages all arrivals to log this information in the <a href=""https://cov19ent.kdca.go.kr/cpassportal/biz/beffatstmnt/main.do?lang=en"">Quarantine COVID19 Defence (Q-Code) system  </a> prior to travel. Paper-based alternatives can be used instead but may result in a slower arrivals process. Travellers from China must use the Q-Code system, not the paper-based alternatives. <br>
Travellers arriving in South Korea do not need to provide a negative pre-departure COVID-19 test certificate unless travelling from China after 5 January 2023, in which case they will need a negative PCR test taken up to 48 hours prior to departure or a negative RAT taken up to 24 hours prior to departure. Travellers arriving from China are required to take a PCR test within 24 hours of arrival (as of 2 January 2023). Other travellers arriving in Korea are not required to take a COVID-19 test on arrival. If you have COVID-19 symptoms and would like to take a COVID-19 test within three days of entering Korea, you can receive a free PCR test at a local health centre. You should call 1339 from inside Korea (English language support is available) for more information. <br>
*Quarantine requirements: There is no quarantine requirement for entry to South Korea. <br>
*Data collection: Make sure you have with you a mobile telephone with the roaming function enabled, and/or the telephone number of a friend, relative or contact who can update the authorities on your state of health, if required. A hotel telephone number will not be accepted.
*If you’re fully vaccinated: There are no special provisions for vaccinated individuals. <br>
*If you’re not fully vaccinated: There are no special provisions for unvaccinated individuals. <br>
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year: If you have recently recovered from COVID-19, you should bring with you an official note from your doctor detailing when you tested positive, what treatment you received and/or what isolation you observed. If you test positive or inconclusive while in Korea, officials will consider this information when deciding how to proceed. Korean health officials have broad discretion in deciding what precautions are required. <br>
*Children and young people: Children aged 17 and under can follow the rules for All travellers to enter South Korea.
*If you’re transiting through South Korea: Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination. <br>
All transit passengers receive a temperature check on arrival in Korea. Symptomatic individuals will be subject to a COVID-19 test and hospitalisation if found positive. Passengers who do not show symptoms and/or test negative may continue their journey. <br>
Transit passengers at Seoul Incheon Airport require a ticket/boarding pass for their onward flight to their final destination. They shoulconfirm with the airline(s) before departure that their bags have been checked through to their final destination (as transit passengers are not able to collect and re-check in baggage on arrival in Incheon Airport). <br>
Transit hotels are available in both Terminals 1 and 2 at Incheon Airport. Layovers in South Korea (i.e. passing through immigration to enter South Korea during a long gap between flights) are possible but you will need to satisfy the regular entry requirements. <br>

Internal Restrictions: <br>
Testing positive for COVID-19: If you think you might have COVID-19 while in South Korea, you should self-isolate immediately and contact the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency on 1339 for guidance (support is available in English). Locations where you can receive a free test are common in most cities. If you are eligible to receive a PCR test, you will usually receive your results via text message within 1-2 days. If you are not eligible to receive a PCR test, you will receive an antigen test which provides results within approximately 30 minutes. <br>
If you test positive for COVID-19, you must comply with self-quarantine and treatment instructions issued by the Korean authorities. The Korean authorities have made clear that if you have no or mild symptoms you will generally be eligible for quarantine and treatment at home, unless you are unable to sufficiently isolate from others. If the Korean authorities judge it necessary, you will be moved to a quarantine centre or a hospital/treatment centre. There is currently no charge for quarantine centre stays or for medical care in a hospital/treatment centre as long as you have not violated any quarantine measures. Fully vaccinated individuals will generally need to quarantine (whether at home or in a facility) for seven days. Korean health authorities generally have broad discretion to apply the rules as they see fit. You may face additional costs from your travel provider if you have to rearrange your travel. Anyone displaying symptoms or returning a positive test result for COVID-19 must comply with self-quarantine and treatment instructions issued by the Korean authorities. <br>
*Public spaces and services: Face masks are compulsory on public transport and in medical facilities. Failure to wear a mask can result in a fine of up to 100,000 Korean Won.
