Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Public spaces and services: Some measures remain in place to limit transmission of COVID-19. See the <a href=""https://covid19.gov.lv/en/support-society/how-behave-safely/covid-19-control-measures"">Latvian government’s COVID-19 website</a> for full details. It is mandatory for facemasks to be worn in all public indoor places, including on public transport, in shops and places of work. People must use a medical face mask or unvalved respirator with a safety level of FFP2 - FFP3 or KN95. Children between the ages of 7 and 12 can use non-medical (fabric) masks. Wearing a facemask does not replace social distancing and disinfection requirements. Wearing a facemask is not obligatory for: <br>
•        children under 7 years of age; <br>
•        anyone with certain medical conditions, for example, if a person has difficulty wearing a mask due to a movement disorder or if the person has a mental health disorder. <br>
The fine for not wearing a facemask when required is 50 Euros. <br>
Latvia will accept the proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. If you are travelling with a printed PDF proof of vaccination status, it must date from 1 November to ensure that the certificate can be scanned successfully, if domestic certification is required. If you are entering premises that require a COVID-19 certificate in Latvia, please download and use the QR code designed for travel. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
*If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
