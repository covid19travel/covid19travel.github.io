","The EU Digital COVID Certificate (available as of 1 July 2021) provides proof that a person has either: <br>
been vaccinated against COVID-19 (vaccine type and manufacturer, number of doses, date of vaccination);<br>
received a negative test result, PCR or rapid antigen, with the name of the test, date and time of test, test centre and result (self-tests are not valid);<br>
recovered from COVID-19 (positive PCR test result valid for 180 days).<br>
When travelling, holders of the EU Digital COVID Certificate will have the same rights as citizens of the visited Member State who have been vaccinated, tested or recovered.<br><br>
Travellers from EU/EEA countries can enter Latvia by presenting one of the following: a certificate of vaccination. The full vaccination course is reached 15 days after the second doses of Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines, or 15 days after the single dose of the Janssen vaccine; a certificate of recovery from COVID-19; a pre-departure negative PCR test taken within 72 hours prior to arrival; a pre-departure negative rapid antigen test taken within 48 hours before boarding the carrier’s vehicle or entering Latvia.<br>
All travellers, including fully vaccinated people, are subject to the requirement for a pre-departure negative PCR test. Fully vaccinated people from the EU, Schengen Associated Countries, Switzerland and the United Kingdom are not subject to the self-isolation requirement. The full vaccination course is reached 15 days after both doses of Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines (or a single dose of the Janssen vaccine).<br>

It is not required to get tested when returning unless the person has been in a particularly high-risk country;
Other travellers are required to get tested before traveling from any country. When returning from a high-risk or particularly high-risk third country, getting tested for Covid-19 is obligatory.

Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Public spaces and services: A state of emergency remains in place until 28 February. Measures are in place to limit transmission of COVID-19. See the <a href=""https://covid19.gov.lv/en"">Latvian government’s COVID-19 website</a> for full details. <br>
It is mandatory for facemasks to be worn indoors, including on public transport, and in crowded outdoor settings such as markets. As of 25 January, all individuals, regardless of your vaccination or recovery status, must use a medical face mask or unvalved respirator with a safety level of FFP2 - FFP3 or KN95. These masks or respirators must be worn in all public places including shops, public transport and places of work. <br>
Wearing a facemask does not replace social distancing and disinfection requirements. Wearing a facemask is not obligatory for:
•        children under 7 years of age; <br>
•        anyone with certain medical conditions, for example, if a person has difficulty wearing a mask due to a movement disorder or if the person has a mental health disorder. <br>
The fine for not wearing a facemask when required is 50 Euros. <br>
Some stores can be visited only by those with COVID-19 certificates. Essential stores such as grocery shops, pharmacies, opticians etc can allow people without a COVID-19 certificate if there are separate queues for vaccinated and unvaccinated visitors. <br>
Latvia will accept the proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. If you are travelling with a printed PDF proof of vaccination status, it must date from 1 November to ensure that the certificate can be scanned successfully, if domestic certification is required. If you are entering premises that require a COVID-19 certificate in Latvia, please download and use the QR code designed for travel. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
*If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
