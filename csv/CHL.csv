International Restrictions:<br>
*All travellers: All travellers should familiarise themselves with the entry rules for Chile before travel. Review the entry requirements into Chile very carefully. These change depending on the COVID ‘Alert Level’ in Chile, at the time of your entry. Chile is currently in Alert Level 1.<br>
•        A pre-departure test is recommended for all travellers arriving in Alert Level 1, but is not mandatory only in this alert level.<br>
•        At Alert Levels 2 and 3, all travellers are required to have a negative pre-departure PCR test SARS-COV-2 (rapid and antigen tests are not accepted), taken no more than 72 hours before boarding the final flight into Santiago. Children under 2 years old do not need to meet this requirement.<br>
Non-resident foreigners are recommended to have a valid Mobility Pass (‘Pase de movilidad’). This is only optional in the lowest alert level (Alert Level 1) but is mandatory for entry in Alert levels 2 and 3.You must validate your vaccination in order to obtain a validMobility Pass with Chilean authorities. To apply for a Mobility Pass visit <a href=""https://mevacuno.gob.cl/"">‘MeVacuno website’</a>. Foreign visitors can create an account with an email address to access the site. You should allow at least 30 days for your Mobility Pass application to be processed. After registering your vaccines, and once approved, a mobility pass document with a QR code will be issued. Children under 6 years old who have not been able to access a vaccination program do not need to meet this requirement<br>
•        Non-resident foreigners need to hold proof of travel insurance covering a minimum of $30,000 USD for COVID-related issues for the entire duration of your stay<br>
All travellers need to <a href=""https://www.c19.cl/"">complete an affidavit</a> (Declaración Jurada) up to 48 hours before boarding. This will generate a QR-code document (sent by e-mail), which you must show to the airline when checking-in and during the health screening process on arrival in Chile. The health authorities will provide the detail of this process by email following the health screening. <br>
Upon arrival, you should follow the instructions of airport authorities regarding testing requirements. You might need to undergo an antigen or PCR test SARS-COV-2, either in the airport or at an external laboratory outside the airport. If the latter, you will need to do this within 24 hours of arrival. If you undergo an antigen test, you will need to wait for the results in the airport. If the result is positive, non-resident foreigners will be denied entry into the country. <br>
Non-resident foreign nationals with two vaccinations will be entitled to a Mobility Pass valid for 30 days and those with a booster shot will be entitled to 90 days. <br>
Please bear in mind that you will be required to show your Mobility Pass to enter many private and public places in Chile. <br>
More information about what you need to do when you enter Chile can be found <a href=""https://www.gob.cl/coronavirus/documentos/"">here</a>, selecting ‘Plan Fronteras Protegidas’. <br>
*Proof of vaccination status: Chile will accept the proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.<br>
The proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record will not suffice to demonstrate your vaccination status when entering Chile. You must validate your vaccination status with Chilean authorities to receive a Mobility Pass. To apply for a Mobility Pass visit <a href=""https://mevacuno.gob.cl/"">‘MeVacuno website’</a>. Foreign visitors can create an account with an email to access the site. <br>
*If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past month: If you test positive for COVID-19 a month preceding your boarding to Chile, and if 72 hours prior to boarding, you continue to test positive, you can replace the negative PCR result by showing Chilean authorities the two positive PCR test results. One of the positive PCR tests must have been taken up to 72 hours prior to boarding, the other positive PCR test must have been taken more than 10 days prior to the date of boarding but less than one month before boarding.<br>
*Children and young people: If you travel with children under 18 years old you must review the documents you will need to show upon entry on the  <a href=""https://chile.gob.cl/chile/en/xplica/ingreso-y-salida-de-menores-del-pais"">Chilean Ministry of Foreign Affairs website</a>.<br>
*Children under 6 years old: All children under 6 years old (including non-resident foreigners) are allowed to enter Chile without a mobility pass carrying:
•        a negative PCR test SARS-COV-2 (rapid and antigen tests are not acceptable), taken no more than 72 hours before boarding the final flight into Santiago. Children under 2 years old do not need to meet this requirement<br>
•        <a href=""https://www.c19.cl/"">complete an affidavit</a> (Declaración Jurada) up to 48 hours before boarding. This will generate a QR-code document (sent by e-mail), which you must show to the airline in check-in and during the health screening process on arrival in Chile. Health authorities at Santiago Airport will request all travellers complete a daily ‘self-report’ – for 7 days – via an online form or ‘C19 AutoReporte’ application. The health authorities will provide the detail of this process by email following the health screening.<br>
*If you’re transiting through Chile: Transiting through Chile on your way to another country without exiting the airport premises and without transiting to a domestic flight is permitted. Nevertheless, if you wish to exit the airport or if your transit comprises flying to another city within Chile, Chilean authorities will require you to meet all the current entry requirements.<br>
  <br>
  <br> 
Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Travel in Chile: The Chilean government provides coronavirus-related information on the <a href=""https://www.gob.cl/coronavirus/"">Official COVID-19 Government website</a>. Travellers arriving in Chile should be aware that local authorities frequently move municipalities (comunas) back and forth through the government “Keep Taking Care Stages Plan” (Plan Seguimos Cuidándonos, Paso a Paso), according to the level of COVID-19 restrictions in place. You should review the Chilean government website to check which alert level your ‘comuna’ is in and if there are restrictions that might affect your travel plans. <br>
The government has updated restrictions in Chile and created a new system based on three different ‘alert level phases’: Alert Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3. These phases correlate with Low, Medium and High Sanitary impact. Rules regarding entry into and within the country change depending on the current alert level in the comuna (municipality) and country. Chile is currently in Alert Level 1.<br>
Mobility Pass for interregional travel: The Chilean government allows Chileans, foreign residents and foreign visitors who have been vaccinated overseas to register for Chile’s Mobility Pass scheme (‘Pase de Movilidad’).<br>
Non-resident foreign travellers will have to present proof of vaccination together with an identity document. This will be valid as a Mobility Pass for internal flights within Chile. <br>
In order to obtain a Mobility Pass, you must fulfil the eligibility criteria on the Chile Government’s MeVacuno website, where you will find more details on accepted vaccines and the process to apply for the Mobility Pass.<br>
Chilean nationals and foreign residents need to enter the website with their clave unica/Chilean C.I. Foreign visitors can create an account with an email. After registering your vaccines, and once approved, a mobility pass with a QR code will be issued. <br>
A Mobility Pass will be requested by Chilean authorities or travel companies when travelling between regions in trips of more than 200 kilometres. An alternative to this requirement for interregional trips will be a negative PCR test result taken in Chile no more than 48 hours before the interregional trip. This alternative will only apply to people that do not have a Mobility Pass and will not apply to people who have had their Mobility Pass disabled. <br>
*Public places and services: You must wear a facemask inside all enclosed public places and open spaces where you cannot maintain social distancing of at least 1 metre. Maintain social distancing at all times and self-isolate immediately if you suspect you have been in contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case. <br>
You will be asked to show your Mobility Pass (‘Pase de Movilidad’) to access public places such as bars, restaurants, cinemas, nightclubs, dance venues, concerts, casinos, bingo halls and leisure activities, as well as sports venues, amusement and theme parks, museums, and fairs.
