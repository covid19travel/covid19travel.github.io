More information about what you need to do when you enter Chile can be found on the <a href=""https://www.gob.cl/coronavirus/documentos/"">Chilean government website</a>, selecting ‘Plan Seguimos Cuidándonos’. <br>
Proof of vaccination status: Your appointment card from vaccination centres cannot be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past month: If you test positive for COVID-19 a month preceding your boarding to Chile, and if 72 hours prior to boarding, you continue to test positive, you can replace the negative PCR result by showing Chilean authorities the two positive PCR test results. One of the positive PCR tests must have been taken up to 72 hours prior to boarding, the other positive PCR test must have been taken more than 10 days prior to the date of boarding but less than one month before boarding. <br>

All travellers will have to comply with the following requirements to enter Easter Island (Rapa Nui): <br>

All passengers flying from abroad must undergo a compulsory antigen test upon arrival on Easter Island (Rapa Nui). <br>
If a person is consistently positive for Covid, two results must be attached: a PCR or antigen test performed 24 hours prior to boarding, and a PCR performed more than 10 days prior to the date of boarding and not more than one month prior to the date of boarding. <br>
If a person is classified as a close contact, they must comply with a quarantine of 7 days from the last contact with the confirmed case. <br>
All persons may be subjected to a Covid test between the first and fifth day of arrival. If the passenger refuses or has a positive result, a mandatory quarantine must be carried out for the following 7 days. <br>
*If you’re transiting through Chile: Transiting through Chile on your way to another country without exiting the airport premises and without transiting to a domestic flight is permitted. Nevertheless, if you wish to exit the airport or if your transit comprises flying to another city within Chile, Chilean authorities will require you to meet all the current entry requirements. <br>
  <br>
  <br> 
Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Travel in Chile: The Chilean government provides coronavirus-related information on the <a href=""https://www.gob.cl/coronavirus/"">Official COVID-19 Government website</a>. Travellers arriving in Chile should be aware that local authorities frequently move municipalities (comunas) back and forth through the government “Keep Taking Care Stages Plan” (Plan Seguimos Cuidándonos, Paso a Paso), according to the level of COVID-19 restrictions in place. You should review the Chilean government website to check which alert level your ‘comuna’ is in and if there are restrictions that might affect your travel plans. <br>
The government has updated restrictions in Chile and created a new system based on three different ‘alert level phases’: Alert Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3. These phases correlate with Low, Medium and High Sanitary impact. Rules regarding entry into and within the country change depending on the current alert level in the comuna (municipality) and country. Chile is currently in Alert Level 1.<br>
Mobility Pass for interregional travel: The Chilean government allows Chileans, foreign residents and foreign visitors who have been vaccinated overseas to register for Chile’s Mobility Pass scheme (‘Pase de Movilidad’).<br>
Non-resident foreign travellers will have to present proof of vaccination together with an identity document. This will be valid as a Mobility Pass for internal flights within Chile. <br>
In order to obtain a Mobility Pass, you must fulfil the eligibility criteria on the Chile Government’s MeVacuno website, where you will find more details on accepted vaccines and the process to apply for the Mobility Pass.<br>
Chilean nationals and foreign residents need to enter the website with their clave unica/Chilean C.I. Foreign visitors can create an account with an email. After registering your vaccines, and once approved, a mobility pass with a QR code will be issued. <br>
A Mobility Pass will be requested by Chilean authorities or travel companies when travelling between regions in trips of more than 200 kilometres. An alternative to this requirement for interregional trips will be a negative PCR test result taken in Chile no more than 48 hours before the interregional trip. This alternative will only apply to people that do not have a Mobility Pass and will not apply to people who have had their Mobility Pass disabled. <br>
*Public places and services: You must wear a facemask inside all enclosed public places and open spaces where you cannot maintain social distancing of at least 1 metre. Maintain social distancing at all times and self-isolate immediately if you suspect you have been in contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case. <br>
You will be asked to show your Mobility Pass (‘Pase de Movilidad’) to access public places such as bars, restaurants, cinemas, nightclubs, dance venues, concerts, casinos, bingo halls and leisure activities, as well as sports venues, amusement and theme parks, museums, and fairs.
