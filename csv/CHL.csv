  <br> 
Internal Restrictions: <br>
**Travel in Chile: Travellers arriving in Chile should be aware that local authorities frequently move municipalities (comunas) back and forth through the government Stages Plan (Paso a Paso). You should review the <ahref=""https://www.gob.cl/coronavirus/pasoapaso#situacioncomunal/"">Chilean Government Paso a Paso website</a> to check which stage your ‘comuna’ is in. <br>
If you are travelling from or to the airport to catch a flight from or to one of the areas under quarantine, presenting your passport and boarding pass will permit you to cross any checkpoints. Use a recognised taxi service or airport transfer whose driver should have the requisite permissions. <br>
From 1 December, travellers arriving in Chile with further domestic flight connections will no longer be required to quarantine on arrival until they receive a negative PCR test result (carried out by health authorities on arrival). They can continue their trip and quarantine in their final destination until they receive a negative PCR test result. <br>
*Mobility Pass for interregional travel: Travellers (including children aged 12 and up) are requested to hold a Mobility Pass for interregional travel. More details on accepted vaccines and the process to apply for the Mobility Pass, including the documents required to validate the vaccination, is available <a href=""https://www.c19.cl/"">here</a>(in Spanish). <br>
The Chilean government allows Chileans, foreigners resident in Chile and non-resident foreigners who have been vaccinated overseas to register for Chile’s Mobility Pass scheme (‘Pase de Movilidad’). You may obtain a Mobility Pass if you fulfil the eligibility criteria on the Chile Government’s <a href=""https://mevacuno.gob.cl/"">MeVacuno website</a>. This will generate a QR-code after entering your personal information. This permit can only be requested 14-days after completing a full COVID-19 vaccination course in Chile (i.e. after the second dose for a two-dose course COVID-19 vaccine such as AstraZeneca, Pfizer, etc). <br>
Interregional travellers without a Mobility Pass are required to provide proof of a negative PCR-test result given within 72 hours prior to travel. This test must be carried out in Chile. You should be aware that you are not allowed interregional travel if you are in quarantine after arriving in Chile. <br>
*Paso a Paso Strategy: The Chilean government’s strategy to manage COVID-19 is called ‘Paso A Paso’. It has five stages: <br>
•        Stage 1 – Restriction <br>
•        Stage 2 – Transition <br>
•        Stage 3 – Preparation <br>
•        Stage 4 - Initial Reopening <br>
•        Stage 5 - Advanced Reopening <br>
Individual comunas will move forwards or backwards between these stages, depending on the level of COVID-19 infections in the region. Changes to the stage of a ‘comuna’ can be announced by the government at any time and come into force shortly after. All rules for each Stage (Paso) will apply seven-days a week. <br>
In those areas under Stage 1 ‘Restriction’ you are only allowed to leave your residence under certain circumstances, including for medical reasons, basic services, and public services. If you need to leave your residence for food or medical supplies, you must get a permit from the <a href=""""></a> Comisaria Virtual. Foreigners may use their passport number to access the system. The pages are only in Spanish. <br>
For further detailed information on rules for every Stage, you should review the Chilean Government <ahref=""https://www.gob.cl/coronavirus/pasoapaso/"">Paso a Paso website</a>. <br>
*Public places and services: Chilean authorities require the use of facemasks in all public spaces, that you keep to social distancing rules; self-isolate immediately if you suspect you have been in contact with a confirmed COVID case irrespective of the ‘Paso a Paso’ stage. <br>
*If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
