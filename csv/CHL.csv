Quarantine orders and sanitary cordons are in place in Santiago and in other parts of the country. There is currently a nationwide curfew (between 10pm and 5am, seven days a week). You should be aware that from 5 April, a nationwide curfew will be in place between 9pm and 5am, seven days a week.

Be aware that if you wish to travel to Magallanes Region, you will need to provide proof of a negative PCR-test result given within 72 hours prior to travel. <br>
Chile is deploying a flexible approach to bringing municipal areas (called comunas) in and out of quarantine/sanitary cordons. New measures can be announced by the government at any time and come into force shortly after. <br>
On 28 July, local areas (“comunas”) in Chile that were under lockdown, as part of the Chilean government’s 5stage plan, began to move from quarantine (Stage 1) into less restrictive stages. The rules on mobility in each stage are as follows: <br>
Stage 1: Quarantine. Restricted mobility; permits required for essential activity only from Monday to Friday; Evening curfew between 2100-0500 (from 5 April), social distancing and cordon sanitaire in place; obligatory quarantine for those over 75, except on Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays between 0900-1100 for 60 minutes or between 1600-1800; prohibition of movement to secondary home. Outdoor exercise activities are allowed from Monday to Sunday between 0600-0900.<br>
Stage 2: Transition. Quarantine remains in place at weekends and bank holidays social gatherings of no more than 5 people allowed inside; Evening curfew between 2100-0500 (from 5 April), social distancing and cordon sanitaire in place and a prohibition on movement to other regions. Outdoor exercise activities are allowed from Monday to Sunday between 0600-0900.<br>
Stage 3: Preparation. Under this stage there are no mobility restrictions within the comuna; social gatherings capped at 15 people; Evening curfew between 2100-0500(from 5 April), social distancing and cordon sanitaire in place; and interregional travel is only allowed to regions in Stage 3, 4 and 5. In/Outdoor activities are allowed. <br>
Stage 4: Initial opening. Significant step that aims to re-open certain low risk activities and to avoid crowds and physical contact. Establishment of a new way of living: COVID MODE. Social gatherings with no more than 30 people permitted; cinemas, theatres, restaurants and cafes allowed to function at 25% capacity; restaurants and cafés allowed to open to the public at 25% capacity; Evening curfew between 2100-0500 (from 5 April), social distancing still required; pubs and clubs remain closed; over 75’s allowed to leave their homes for 60 minutes per day; Interregional travel is only allowed to regions in Stage 3, 4 and 5. You require a special holiday permit if you are travelling to a secondary home located on a region in Stage 2. <br>
Stage 5: Advanced opening. This step relies on the population becoming accustomed to activities in COVID MODE. Social gatherings with no more than 150 people permitted; cinemas, theatres, restaurants and cafes allowed to function at 75% capacity; gyms, pubs and clubs can function at 50% capacity; gradual return to physical classes in education establishments.<br>
Social distancing of 1 metre; free movement for those over 75 and movement to secondary homes allowed.
The Government’s <a href=""https://www.gob.cl/pasoapaso/"">‘Paso a Paso’ website</a> outlines which phase-out stage each comuna of Chile is under the heading (‘Situación Comunal’).<br>
In areas in quarantine you are only allowed to leave your residence under certain circumstances, including for medical reasons, basic services, and public services. If you need to leave your residence for food supplies or medical reasons, you must get a permit from the <a href=""https://comisariavirtual.cl/"">Comisaria Virtual</a>. Foreigners may use their passport number to access the system. The pages are only in Spanish.<br>
The government has introduced a special holiday permit (until 31 March 2021) for residents in comunas in ‘Transition’ or Stage 2. This does not apply to tourists or non-resident foreign nationals, only to Chileans and foreign residents. For more information, please see the <a href=""https://www.gob.cl/pasoapaso/"">official Chilean advice</a>. <br>
Individuals that wish to pass the sanitary cordons must obtain a<a href=""https://comisariavirtual.cl/"">“Salvoconducto” permit </a> and a<a href=""https://www.c19.cl/formularios.html"">“Health Passport”</a> (“pasaporte sanitario”) (under “viajeros regionales” for residents or “viajeros regionales” for foreign visitors), at least 24 hours before.
Information on the areas of Chile that have sanitary cordons is available on the Government’s<a href=""https://www.gob.cl/coronavirus/plandeaccion/"">‘Plan de Acción’</a>. <br>
Checkpoints for health inspections are in force at various points around Santiago and elsewhere. In addition to checking the health of persons passing through, these checkpoints will be used to confirm that specific individuals who have been ordered to quarantine by medical authorities are not violating their quarantine. You will need to get a<a href=""https://www.c19.cl/"">“Health Passport”</a> prior to travel and present it at any checkpoint. <br>
*Public places and services: Chilean authorities require the use of face masks in all public spaces, irrespective of what stage of the quarantine phase-out a comuna is in.
