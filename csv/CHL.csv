Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Travel in Chile: The Chilean government provides coronavirus-related information on the <a href=""https://www.gob.cl/coronavirus/"">Official COVID-19 Government website</a>. Travellers arriving in Chile should be aware that local authorities frequently move municipalities (comunas) back and forth through the government “Stages Plan” (Paso a Paso) according to the level of COVID-19 restrictions in place. You should review the <a href=""https://www.gob.cl/coronavirus/pasoapaso#situacioncomunal/"">Chilean Government Paso a Paso website</a> to check which stage your ‘comuna’ is in and if there are restrictions that might affect your travel plans. <br>
*Mobility Pass for interregional travel: The Chilean government allows Chileans, foreigner residents and foreigner visitors who have been vaccinated overseas to register for Chile’s Mobility Pass scheme (‘Pase de Movilidad’). Travellers (including children aged 12 and above) are required to hold a valid Mobility Pass for inter-regional travel.

Chilean nationals and foreign residents need to enter the website with their clave unica/Chilean C.I. Foreign visitors can create an account with an email. After registering your vaccines, and once approved, a mobility pass with a QR code will be issued. For details about using the Mobility Pass to transfer to a domestic flight after arriving in Chile, see the ‘Entry requirements’ section. <br>
