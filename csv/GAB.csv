Travellers holding a diplomatic passport and their travel orders must comply with the mandatory PCR testing at the airport (CFA 20,000), but do not quarantine in a government-designated hotel and do not leave their passport at the airport. This applies whether the diplomat is vaccinated or not. <br>
If a COVID-19 test taken at the airport is positive, then passengers are required to continue self-isolation and await specific instructions from Gabonese health authorities. Visitors to Gabon will have to go to one of the hotels which the government of Gabon has nominated for isolation. British nationals resident in Gabon who test positive are required to isolate at home and dial the toll free number 1410 for further instructions. All COVID-19 tests taken in Gabon supersede any that were taken before arrival in Gabon.
