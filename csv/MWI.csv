Testing centres are located at a number of Government approved facilities, including: Mzuzu Central Hospital (Mzuzu), Kamuzu Central Hospital (Lilongwe), Public Health Institute (Lilongwe), Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital (Blantyre) and Zomba Central Hospital (Zomba). Please seek guidance from your local medical provider on how you can obtain a COVID-19 test. Mandatory COVID-19 testing will also take place on departure if you fail to produce a valid negative test certificate or if the airport staff judge you to display COVID-19 symptoms. This test will be at your own expense and may delay your departure.
