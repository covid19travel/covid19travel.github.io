*Travel in Seychelles: The Government of Seychelles has extended COVID-19 restrictions across the country until further notice.
The Ministry of Health in Seychelles issues new and additional measures on the <a href=""http://www.health.gov.sc/"">Ministry of Health website</a> and on Ministry of Health social media channels. <br>
If you’re living in Seychelles or intend to travel to Seychelles, you’re strongly advised to familiarise yourself with these measures and to follow public health guidelines. You should avoid travelling unnecessarily within the country, including between islands. You should wear a mask and observe social distancing at all times when in public. <br>
*Accommodation: Some hotels are open across Seychelles. If you have made a booking, you should make contact with your tour operator or hotel proprietor before travelling to Seychelles. <br>
*Public spaces and services: The Government of Seychelles has introduced new restrictions on the use of public spaces and services, following an increase in the number of coronavirus cases in Seychelles. These measures will remain in place until further notice. <br>
A nationwide curfew is in place from 11pm to 4am. You should not travel outside your accommodation between these times without authorisation. Restrictions on movement are reviewed regularly. House parties are not permitted and no gatherings of more than four persons, indoors or outdoors, including on beaches and in public places, are allowed. <br>
All shops must close at 7pm. Bars and casinos may open until 10pm. Restrictions are enforceable by law and can change at short notice. You should consult the Ministry of Health in Seychelles for further information and monitor local media for the latest developments. <br>
*If you test positive for COVID-19 : The Government of Seychelles does not routinely require travellers to take a PCR test before departure. Airlines or final destinations, however, may require it, and you should check the requirements if necessary. Visitors who develop symptoms of a possible respiratory infection will be referred to health services for further assessment and testing. You can expect to be contacted by the authorities in Seychelles if you test positive for COVID-19. If you display severe symptoms, particularly if you are in an at-risk category, then you may be cared for at a government-run facility. <br>
*Symptomatic Cases: The Seychelles Department of Foreign Affairs and Tourism has produced a  <a href=""https://tourism.gov.sc/2021/06/01/travel-advisory-for-visitors-from-permitted-countries/"">travel advisory</a> which details the standard procedures for visitors who develop symptoms. Visitors who develop symptoms of possible respiratory infection (fever, cough, shortness of breath, or loss of smell/taste) will be referred to the health services for further assessment. If a visitor is found to be infected with COVID-19, the Public Health Authority requires that the person is isolated from the population and other visitors until recovery from infection. Symptomatic cases, especially for those in ‘high-risk’ categories will be cared for in a health-managed isolation facility.
*Asymptomatic Cases: Asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic cases must undergo isolation at a certified tourism accommodation establishment at their own cost. People who are asymptomatic throughout their self-isolation can expect to self-isolate for 10 days, while mildly symptomatic visitors must self-isolate for 14 days. Guests may not change accommodation during a period of self-isolation without the permission of the Public Health Authority. <br>
If parents are required to self-isolate, then minors will be expected to stay with them or with other family members. Unaccompanied minors (i.e. under 18 years of age) will normally be treated as adults.<br>
If you are travelling with children, you should contact the <a href=""http://www.health.gov.sc/"">Seychelles Ministry of Health</a> before you travel to confirm you are satisfied with the procedures in place should you be required to self-isolate during your stay.
