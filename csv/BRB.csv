*Entry to Barbados: Barbados has published travel protocols setting out its entry requirements in relation to COVID-19. Visit the <a href=""https://www.visitbarbados.org/covid-19-travel-guidelines-2020"">Visit Barbados website</a> for full details. You should read these before your departure and monitor the pages on a regular basis as the requirements may change at short notice. Masks should be worn at all times during your travel to Barbados and your passage through the airport. Social distancing and hygiene protocols are in place. <br>
*Arrive with a COVID 19 negative test: All travellers from the UK must present on arrival either: <br>
•        a valid RT-PCR COVID-19 negative test result taken no more than 3 days in advance of your flight’s arrival. Please note that the test can be taken at any time during the day 3 days prior to the date of your arrival in Barbados.

•        a valid Rapid PCR COVID-19 negative test result taken one day before arrival in Barbados <br>
Accepted tests include tests which were taken at an approved or recognised laboratory by a healthcare provider via a nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal sample (or both). Your test certificate should provide this information. LAMP tests, rapid antigen tests, self-administered tests or home kits or tests using saliva samples will not be accepted. You should check the protocols to confirm and understand all requirements. Relevant test accrediting bodies and standards authorities include: ISO 15189, CAP, UKAS or the equivalent. <br>
All passengers are also required to submit an Embarkation/Disembarkation (ED) card 24 hours prior to travel, to which they should upload their negative test result via <a href=""https://www.travelform.gov.bb/home"">Travel Form</a>. The BIMSafe app can also be used. <br>
If you arrive in Barbados from the UK without a valid negative PCR test, you may be denied entry to the country. You should arrange to take a private test. On arrival all passengers are also subject to a health screen. <br>
If you have recovered from recently diagnosed COVID-19 and your pre-flight PCR test is still positive, you should bring a letter from your medical practitioner with lab test results showing the date of diagnosis and recovery. You may be obliged on arrival to complete an assessment at one of the government isolation facilities for up to 48 hours before being released from quarantine. <br>
*Demonstrating your COVID-19 status: Barbados will accept the proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
*Fully vaccinated arrivals: Fully vaccinated persons (2 doses administered more than 14 days prior to arrival) must arrive with evidence of an RT-PCR test taken during the three days prior to arrival in Barbados. <br>
Details of what the Barbadian authorities will accept as proof of vaccination can be found in the <a href=""https://www.visitbarbados.org/covid-19-travel-guidelines-2020"">Barbados Travel Protocols</a>. If you are unable to provide sufficient proof that you have been vaccinated then you will be treated as if you are unvaccinated. A number of fully vaccinated arrivals will be randomly chosen to have a rapid antigen test. There is no requirement to quarantine, as the result will be made available very quickly. See the <a href=""https://www.visitbarbados.org/covid-19-travel-guidelines-2020"">Barbados Travel Protocols</a> for further details. <br>

*Testing positive for / close contact with COVID-19 in Barbados: If you test positive for COVID-19 at any point during your stay in Barbados you will be required to self-isolate. You will first be assessed by a member of staff from the government isolation facilities for 24 hours. You may be transferred to the Government’s quarantine facility, Harrison’s Point, for further assessment and treatment. You can stay there for no cost until you have recovered. Conditions at the government quarantine facilities are generally basic and not necessarily equivalent to a tourist hotel with the associated services. <br>
Alternatively, you may be eligible for the Government’s home isolation programme and you have the option of requesting to self-isolate at your hotel, apartment or villa, or government approved isolation property under strict stipulations that must be signed and adhered to. This will be at your own expense. You will need to remain at your designated accommodation until the Barbadian authorities are satisfied that you have recovered. This may mean a mandatory stay of several weeks in Barbados. Upon recovery, tourists can continue their holiday or return home. The option to self-isolate in an approved hotel, villa or property is not a right – the decision will be made by healthcare professionals. See the <a href=""https://www.visitbarbados.org/covid-19-travel-guidelines-2020"">Barbados Travel Protocols</a> for full details of isolation options, facilities and requirements. <br>
If you are deemed to have been in close contact with a positive COVID-19 case, you will be required to quarantine at approved facilities. See <a href=""https://www.visitbarbados.org/covid-19-travel-guidelines-2020"">Barbados Travel Protocols</a> for full details. <br>
You can find full and definitive details of the protocols at <a href=""https://www.visitbarbados.org/covid-19-travel-guidelines-2020"">Visit Barbados website</a> and are advised to read and understand the requirements carefully before departure. <br>
You should monitor the <a href=""https://www.visitbarbados.org/covid-19-travel-guidelines-2020"">Visit Barbados website</a> on a regular basis as the Government of Barbados may change the requirements without notice.<br>

Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Travel in Barbados: Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Barbados to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19). Details of these measures can be found at the <a href=""https://gisbarbados.gov.bb/"">Barbados Government Information Service website</a> and / or <a href=""https://m.facebook.com/gisbarbados/?tn-str=k%2AF&_rdr"">Facebook page</a> and the <a href=""https://www.visitbarbados.org/covid-19-travel-guidelines-2020"">Visit Barbados Travel Protocols</a>.<br>
The Government’s COVID-19 protocols may be subject to change at short notice and you should therefore review these regularly. All persons arriving in Barbados are required to wear face masks at all times whilst on airport grounds. Persons will also have their temperature taken. In moving around Barbados, follow social distancing protocols.<br>
Masks are mandatory in all public spaces, including out-of-doors unless you are exercising. You can expect to have your temperature taken and you may be asked to supply your contact details when entering some premises. Regular washing of hands is encouraged and you can expect to be asked to clean your hands using hand sanitizer on entering a building. <br>
You may be required to quarantine and/or undergo a further COVID-19 test at any stage of your stay if the Barbados authorities deem that you have been in close contact with a COVID-19 positive individual or mandatory monitoring highlights potential COVID-19 symptoms. <br>
There is currently a curfew in place every day from midnight to 5am. Indoor parties are prohibited. There are restrictions on size of gatherings outdoors. The Barbadian authorities will seek to prosecute people who breach COVID-19 protocols, including those who break quarantine protocols, which may result in a fine and/or prison sentence. <br>
