*Travel in Romania: Travel to/from airport or other port of arrival: Due to movement restrictions in place, when travelling to the airport make sure you carry: <br>
•        your passport <br>
•        your flight ticket <br>
Road transit across or through Romania is possible. Carry your passport at all times. <br>
*Requirements when travelling e.g. public transport, taxis: You are required to carry a face mask in all indoor spaces, including public transport and taxis. Drivers are also required to comply with this requirement. <br>
*Accommodation: Hotels, guesthouses, camping units have been allowed to open, but only when observing a specific set health-safety of rules. <br>
*Public spaces and services: Whilst the State of Alert remains in place, the Romanian government regularly reviews regulations related to mask wearing, shop and restaurant opening, public events, concerts and conferences. From 8 January, wearing a medical-grade mask is a legal requirement in all closed and public spaces. It is necessary to show proof of your vaccination or recovery status to access restaurants and events. The decrees can be found on the <a href=""https://www.mai.gov.ro/utile/"">Romanian government website  </a> (in Romanian). <br>
Romania will accept the proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
You should also check the restrictions in place for the specific areas of Romania you plan to visit as individual counties may adjust local regulations dependent on the rate of infection. You can find the records of daily rates of infection on the <a href=""https://datelazi.ro/"">website</a> (in Romanian). <br>
*If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
