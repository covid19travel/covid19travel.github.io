Internal Restrictions: <br> 
*Public spaces and services: The Belgian government has a number of measures in place to limit the spread of COVID-19. It is mandatory to wear face masks in the following indoor spaces for those above 12 years old: <br>
•        stores and shopping centres <br>
•        care establishments <br>
•        publicly accessible areas in businesses, companies, public buildings, courthouse buildings <br>
•        cultural and events venues, including in museums, cinemas, theatres and concert halls <br>
•        libraries, game/toy libraries and media libraries <br>
•        places of worship <br>
•        healthcare facilities, hairdressers, nail salons and other contact service providers <br>
•        public transport, including at stations and airports <br>
Shops remain open but need to adhere to a ‘one customer per square metre’ rule. Customers will only be permitted to shop with one other person (not including minors). <br>
Outdoor activities remain open but are subject to restricted capacity. <br>
To enter into bars, restaurants, cafés, fitness centres and many other permitted indoor spaces and events, you will be required to demonstrate your COVID safe status through the Belgian <a href=""https://covidsafe.be/en/"">Covid Safe Ticket (CST) system  </a> showing proof of vaccination, a recent negative test or a recovery certificate. <br>
From 1 March 2022, those who have received a second vaccine dose (or, in the case of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, their sole dose) more than 150 days ago, will no longer count as fully vaccinated for domestic purposes within Belgium without a booster shot. Therefore they will need additional proof of Covid safe status (e.g. negative test, recovery certificate) to enter specific venues (e.g. restaurants and bars, cinemas, most museums, and many events). <br>
These measures are kept under active review and are subject to an ongoing assessment of local conditions. There are also some regional differences in the implementation of measures. You should regularly check the website of the relevant city or town and the <a href=""https://www.info-coronavirus.be/en/faq/"">Belgian government advice website</a> for the latest detailed information. <br>
Accommodation: All types of accommodation are permitted to open subject to compliance with general rules related to COVID-19. Details are available on the <a href=""https://www.info-coronavirus.be/en/faq/#faq"">Belgian Government  </a> website. Check with your accommodation provider for further information. <br>
*If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. Belgian authorities are likely to conduct calls to check you are quarantining. You may also need to seek treatment there.
