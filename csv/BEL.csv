","THIS COUNTRY IS READY TO CONNECT TO THE EU DIGITAL COVID CERTIFICATE GATEWAY <br>
A vaccination certificate proves that you have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19. You are fully vaccinated 2 weeks after your last vaccination dose and if the vaccine is <a href=""https://www.info-coronavirus.be/en/recognised-vaccins-and-certificates/#recognisedvaccins"">EMA-certified</a> or Covishield. From 1 September, <a href=""https://www.info-coronavirus.be/en/recognised-vaccins-and-certificates/#vaccinationcertificates"">vaccination certificates from non-EU countries</a> will also be accepted in Belgium under certain conditions, pending their equivalence agreement with the EU.
<br>
The EU Digital COVID Certificate (available as of 1 July 2021) provides proof that a person has either: <br>
been vaccinated against COVID-19 (vaccine type and manufacturer, number of doses, date of vaccination); <br>
received a negative test result, PCR or rapid antigen, with the name of the test, date and time of test, test centre and result (self-tests are not valid);<br>
recovered from COVID-19 (positive PCR test result valid for 180 days).<br>
When travelling, holders of the EU Digital COVID Certificate will have the same rights as citizens of the visited Member State who have been vaccinated, tested or recovered.<br><br>
Non-essential travel to Belgium from non-EU “red zones” is prohibited for people who are neither nationals of the EU, nor of a country that is part of the Schengen Area, and who have their primary residence in a non-EU ‘red zone” (third countries not listed in Annex I to Council Recommendation), except for fully vaccinated individuals with a recognised vaccination certificate as from 1 July 2021.<br>
Authorised travellers from a ""red zone"" outside the European Union who can present a recognised European or Belgian certificate of vaccination or recovery certificate must get tested on day 1 or day 2 after their arrival in Belgium. If the result is negative the quarantine is lifted. This does not apply to children under the age of 12. Authorised travellers who do not have a vaccination or recovery certificate must quarantine for 10 days and get tested on days 1 and 7 after their arrival","Latest News:

International Restrictions: <br>
*From within the EU: <p>The Belgian Government has introduced a traffic light system of ""<strong>green</strong><strong>"", ""</strong><strong>orange</strong><strong>"", ""</strong><strong>red</strong><strong>""</strong><strong> and </strong><strong>""</strong><strong>very</strong> <strong>high-risk</strong><strong>""</strong> zones. Belgium's classification isupdated every Sunday and is valid from the Monday immediately following. It is based on the data and criteria communicated by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) every Thursday. Each country is given a colour code (red, orange, green). The measures applicable to travel to Belgium depend on the colour code assigned to each country. In addition to the colour code, countries of origin may also be classified as &ldquo;very high-risk"" zones, to which additional stricter measures apply. From 19 July 2021 stricter rules can apply to travellers coming from EU and Schengen associated countries characterised by high rates of <strong>variants of concern</strong>, regardless of the colour classification.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.info-coronavirus.be/en/faq/"">Find out the current colour code assigned by Belgium to each country</a>.</p>
<p>The country or region has to be classified ""orange"" or ""green"" for at least 14 days, without being classified as &ldquo;very high-risk&rdquo; zone, before being exempted from the requirements applied to ""red"" zones and &ldquo;very high-risk&rdquo; zones.</p>
<p>ALSO: Travellers can access Belgium if they fill in the <a href=""https://travel.info-coronavirus.be/public-health-passenger-locator-form"">Passenger Location Form (PLF)</a> <strong>within 6 months before</strong> their arrival in Belgium, even if they are fully vaccinated.</p>
<p><strong>Are a coronavirus test or quarantine required?</strong></p>
<p>All travellers from an <strong>EU</strong> <strong>""red zone&rdquo;,</strong> who do not have a vaccination or recovery certificate, must present a test certificate prior to arrival. Belgian residents can get tested on day 1 or 2 after the arrival in Belgium and must undergo a quarantine while waiting for the result. If the test is negative, they can end the quarantine. A second test must be taken on day 7. If any of these tests is positive, a quarantine of 10 days must be observed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When arriving from an EU or Schengen associated country with <strong>high rates of variants of concern</strong>, regardless of their colour classification, people who have not been fully vaccinated for at least 2 weeks must present a test certificate before arrival, or on day 1 after the arrival for Belgian residents (in this case, a quarantine must be observed while waiting for the results). If the test is negative, they can end the quarantine. A second test must be taken on day 7. If any of these tests is positive, a quarantine of 10 days must be observed.&nbsp; More information on inbound travel exemptions because of the &ldquo;essential reasons&rdquo; is available at: <a href=""http://info-coronavirus.be/"">https://www.info-coronavirus.be/en/countries-with-high-risk/</a></p>

*From Third Countries: <p>Non-essential travel to countries outside the European Union and the Schengen Area is strongly discouraged.
