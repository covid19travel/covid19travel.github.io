International Restrictions: <br>
Entry and borders: Upon arrival, all non-exempt foreign nationals are required to provide proof of health insurance that covers COVID-19 observation and treatment for the duration of their stay. Insurance must be purchased from a company registered in Ukraine or a foreign company that has a representative office or an insurance partner in Ukraine. <br>
From 24 March 2021, all non-exempt foreign nationals must also provide proof of a negative PCR test, taken no more than 72 hours in advance of their arrival in Ukraine. This does not apply to children under 12 years of age. Though the Ukrainian government is yet to set out the full details, presenting this test should also mean that foreign nationals do not need to self-isolate on arrival and do not need to download the <a href=""https://visitukraine.today/#diya"">Diia Vdoma app</a>. This page will be updated with further details as they become available. <br>
According to the resolution 1236 (9 December 2020) of the Ukrainian Government (Cabinet of Ministers), as updated on 22 March 2021, certain categories of foreign nationals are exempt from the insurance and PCR testing requirements: foreign nationals who are: residents of Ukraine; recognised as refugees; accredited diplomats in Ukraine, or members of accredited diplomats’ families; air, sea, and land transport crews; or military personnel from NATO or “Partnership for Peace” countries taking part in exercises with the Ukrainian military. <br>
It is not possible for non-exempted foreign nationals to take a PCR test once inside Ukraine, or self-isolate, in order to avoid the requirement for a pre-arrival negative PCR test. <br>
The final decision on a person’s eligibility to enter Ukraine rests with the Ukrainian State Border Service. The entry requirement policies of foreign governments are imposed and enforced at their discretion. <br>
*Transiting Ukraine: Foreign nationals transiting Ukraine are required to provide proof of health insurance that covers COVID-19 observation and treatment for the duration of their stay. Insurance must be purchased from a company registered in Ukraine or a foreign company that has a representative office or an insurance partner in Ukraine. <br>
*Quarantine requirements: Foreign nationals with a valid negative PCR test should not have to self-isolate on arrival in Ukraine, although this has not been made explicit in the government of Ukraine’s announcements so far. This page will be updated with further details as they become available. It is not possible to self-isolate as an alternative to the requirement to take a PCR test before arrival. <br>
Ukrainian citizens (including those with dual nationality) and foreign residents of Ukraine must self-isolate on arrival for 14 days, unless they take a PCR test and receive a negative result no more than 48 (not 72) hours before arrival in Ukraine. Residents or Ukrainian nationals arriving in Ukraine without a negative PCR test must install the <a href=""https://visitukraine.today/#diya"">Dii Vdoma tracking app</a> for their 14-day self-isolation. The 14 day self-isolation can be terminated early by taking a PCR test and receiving a negative result. <br>
Self-isolation on entry to Ukraine can be completed at your chosen address using the <a href="""">“Dii Vdoma” mobile app</a>. You need to have a Ukrainian mobile phone number with the SIM card activated before you arrive in the country, though the SIM does not need to be in your phone on arrival. When using the app, you must respond promptly to notifications sent to your mobile (in Ukrainian). <br>
More information about the app is available on the <a href="""">Cabinet of Ministers website</a> or the <a href=""https://visitukraine.today/#diya"">Visit Ukraine webpage</a>. Make sure that you understand the regular reporting requirements before taking up this option. People who do not register with the <a href=""https://visitukraine.today/#diya"">Dii Vdoma app</a>, or who do not abide by its terms, are required to complete quarantine at a government-approved observation centre. <br>
Travellers arriving in Ukraine or crossing the administrative points from non-government-controlled parts of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts and Crimea will be subject to health monitoring on arrival. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.
