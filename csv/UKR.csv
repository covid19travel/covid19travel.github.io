Internal restrictions: <br>
Authorities in Kyiv tighten lockdown restrictions because of spike in COVID-19 cases; negative test or vaccine certificate will also be mandatory to use public transport (Reuters, 28.10.2021). <br>
*Travel in Ukraine: Domestic flights are operating, although some carriers are operating a reduced schedule. Public transport in cities and bus and train travel between regions are also operating on a reduced scale. From 21 October, you will need a vaccine certificate or negative PCR or express-test taken within 72 hours of travel, if travelling inter-city (by train, bus or plane) to or from a “yellow”, “orange” or “red” zone. <br>
*Quarantine measures: Coronavirus measures are in place until 31 December 2021, but may be extended further. Ukraine is operating a colour-coded adaptive quarantine system on a regional (oblasts and Kyiv city) basis. Some oblasts and cities have imposed additional measures beyond their official “zone” and these measures may be imposed, and change, at short notice. You should check which restrictions apply to the places you intend to visit, and be ready to prove your vaccination status. <br>
In all zones, the following rules apply: <br>
•        you must carry ID with you at all times <br>
•        when in public buildings (including restaurants, hotels and shops) you must maintain a minimum distance of 1.5 m. <br>
•        when in public buildings, and while travelling on public transport and in taxis, you must wear a protective mask covering your nose and mouth <br>
Failure to comply with restrictions may result in a fine or, in more serious cases, a prison sentence. Before taking public transport, you should consider whether you will be able to maintain social distancing. <br>
In regions classified as “green” zones, there are minimal restrictions beyond mask-wearing and distancing. <br>
In “yellow” and “orange” zones, there are size limits imposed on outdoor mass events, and capacity limits for indoor hospitality, entertainment, cultural, fitness, retail and educational establishments. These restrictions can be waived if 80% of staff are vaccinated. <br>
In “red” zones, the following conditions apply. There are exemptions if organisations can demonstrate that 100% of staff / customers / participants are vaccinated or have recent negative COVID-19 test results: <br>
•        the hospitality sector (except for takeaway or delivery), entertainment and cultural facilities, shopping malls, non-essential retail, gyms, fitness centres and swimming pools must close <br>
•        public events are prohibited <br>
•        supermarkets and other grocery stores, pharmacies, veterinary supplies shops, banks and petrol stations can open <br>
•        public transport can still operate <br>
*Accommodation: Hotel accommodation remains open under the present quarantine rules, but hostels should be closed in yellow, orange or red zones. In red zones, hotels have further restrictions placed on them, and their restaurant facilities are likely to be closed. When staying in a hotel, you must adhere to the overall rules regarding masks and minimum distancing. If possible, check in online in advance to avoid check-in queues at the hotel. <br>
