International Restrictions: <br>
*Entry requirements: Upon arrival, all non-exempt foreign nationals are required to provide proof of health insurance that covers COVID-19 observation and treatment for the duration of their stay. Insurance must be purchased from a company registered in Ukraine or a foreign company that has a representative office or an insurance partner in Ukraine. <br>
All non-exempt foreign nationals, in addition to their health insurance policy, must have: <br>
•        a document confirming receipt of at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccination with WHO-approved vaccines – which Ukraine lists as Pfizer, AstraZeneca (Vaxzevria, Covishield and SKBio), Janssen, Moderna, Sinopharm and CoronaVac, or one of: <br>
•        a negative Rapid Antigen Test taken no more than 72 hours before entry, or; <br>
•        a negative PCR test taken no more than 72 hours before entry. <br>
The requirement for proof of vaccination or a negative test does not apply to children under 12. <br>
Non-exempt foreign nationals without proof of vaccination (ie one or both doses) will be required on arrival to install the “Vdoma” app, which monitors self-isolation. The State Border Service will refuse entry to anyone who is unable, or refuses, to install the “Vdoma” app. See the official <a href=""https://www.visitukraine.today/"">Visit Ukraine site  </a> and click “more details” for further information. <br>
During the first 72 hours after arrival (unless travelling from Russia), you can take a PCR or Rapid Antigen test. If you test negative for COVID-19, you will not need to self-isolate. If you do not take a test in those 72 hours, you must begin self-isolating at the address you register on the Vdoma app, for 10 days. You can end self-isolation early if you receive a negative PCR or Rapid Antigen test result. <br>
Unvaccinated travellers (with certain exceptions listed on <a href=""http://visitukraine.today/"">Visit Ukraine</a>) who travel from Russia (including for transit through Ukraine) and have spent 7 or more days of the previous 14 days in those countries, will have to self-isolate for 14 days and will not be able to take a test in Ukraine to avoid or reduce self-isolation. <br>
As of 3 December 2021, foreigners without a residence permit or other exemption (see Visit Ukraine for details) who have spent more than 7 of the last 14 days in South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique or Malawi, are not permitted to enter Ukraine. Those with a residence permit or exemption may enter, but must undergo a mandatory 14-day self-isolation and will not be able to take a test to reduce the period of self-isolation.
*Exemptions for foreign nationals: According to the resolution 1236 (9 December 2020) of the Ukrainian Government (Cabinet of Ministers), as updated on 25 October 2021, certain categories of foreign nationals are exempt from the insurance, PCR/RAT/express testing or vaccination requirements, and do not have to install the “Vdoma” app.<br>
These categories include foreign nationals who are: <br>
•        recognised as refugees; <br>
•        accredited diplomats in Ukraine, or members of accredited diplomats’ families; <br>
•        air, sea, and land transport crews, or; <br>
•        military personnel from NATO or “Partnership for Peace” countries taking part in exercises with the Ukrainian military. <br>
The full list of exemptions is available on <a href=""https://www.visitukraine.today/"">Visit Ukraine</a> (click “more details” and scroll to the bottom). <br>
Foreign nationals who are permanent residents of Ukraine are exempt from the insurance and PCR/RAT testing requirement, though they must provide a document confirming receipt of one or more doses of a recognised COVID-19 vaccine or install the Vdoma mobile app and self-isolate for 10 days. Self-isolation is no longer required if you undergo PCR testing or a rapid antigen test within 72 hours of entry and get a negative result; except for permanent residents of Ukraine on arrival from Russia, who are subject to self-isolation for 14 days without the possibility of early termination. <br>
The final decision on a person’s eligibility to enter Ukraine rests with the Ukrainian State Border Service. The entry requirement policies of foreign governments are imposed and enforced at their discretion.
*Demonstrating your COVID-19 status: Ukraine will accept the proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
*Transiting Ukraine: Foreign nationals transiting Ukraine are required to provide documents confirming their departure from the country within 48 hours and proof of health insurance that covers COVID-19 observation and treatment for the duration of their stay. Insurance must be purchased from a company registered in Ukraine or a foreign company that has a representative office or an insurance partner in Ukraine. Transiting travellers are exempt from self-isolation, installing the Vdoma application, and undergoing testing in Ukraine. <br>
Travellers arriving in Ukraine or crossing the administrative points from non-government-controlled parts of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts and Crimea will be subject to health monitoring on arrival. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities. <br>

<br>
Internal restrictions: <br>
*Travel in Ukraine: Although not widely enforced due to the ongoing war, you require a vaccine certificate or negative PCR or express-test taken within 72 hours of travel, if travelling inter-city (by train, bus or plane). <br>
*Quarantine measures: COVID-19 quarantine measures are theoretically in place until 31 August 2022, but have been suspended since the introduction of martial law. Masks are not obligatory, though they remain “recommended” in public places. <br>
*Accommodation: Hotel accommodation remains open under the present COVID-19 quarantine rules, but security and availability are severely affected by the ongoing invasion. Hostels may only open in yellow, orange or red zones if all staff and customers are vaccinated. Hotel restaurant facilities are subject to the same rules as other restaurants, and will likely require a vaccinate certificate or negative Covid test for all customers. When staying in a hotel, you must adhere to the overall rules regarding masks and minimum distancing. If possible, check in online in advance to avoid check-in queues at the hotel. <br>
