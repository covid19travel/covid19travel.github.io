International Restrictions: <br>
*All travellers: Upon arrival, all foreign nationals are required to provide proof of health insurance that covers COVID-19 observation and treatment for the duration of their stay, unless they are exempt. Insurance must be purchased from a company registered in Ukraine or a foreign company that has a representative office or an insurance partner in Ukraine. <br>
*If you’re fully vaccinated: If you’re fully vaccinated, you will need to provide a document confirming receipt of at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccination with WHO-approved vaccines. Ukraine lists these as Pfizer, AstraZeneca (Vaxzevria, Covishield and SKBio), Janssen, Moderna, Sinopharm and CoronaVac. This is in addition to the requirement to provide proof of health insurance that covers COVID-19. <br>
*Proof of vaccination status: Ukraine will accept the  proof of COVID-19 vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
Non-exempt foreign nationals without proof of vaccination (ie one or both doses) will be required on arrival to install the “Vdoma” app, which monitors self-isolation. The State Border Service will refuse entry to anyone who is unable, or refuses, to install the “Vdoma” app. See the official <a href=""https://www.visitukraine.today/"">Visit Ukraine site</a> and click “more details” for further information. <br>
*If you’re not fully vaccinated: If you’re not fully vaccinated, you will need to present a negative Rapid Antigen Test, taken no more than 72 hours before entry, or a negative PCR test taken no more than 72 hours before entry to Ukraine. This is in addition to the requirement to provide proof of health insurance that covers COVID-19. You will also be required to install the Vdoma app on your phone. <br>
*If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year: Ukraine will accept the proof of COVID-19 recovery record to demonstrate proof of COVID-19 recovery. <br>
*Residents of Ukraine: As of 3 December 2021, foreigners with a residence permit or exemption may enter, but must undergo a mandatory 14-day self-isolation and will not be able to take a test to reduce the period of self-isolation. <br>
*Children and young people: Children under 12 do not have to provide proof of vaccination or a negative test to enter Ukraine. <br>
*If you’re transiting through Ukraine: If you’re transiting Ukraine, you are required to provide documents confirming your departure from the country within 48 hours and proof of health insurance that covers COVID-19 observation and treatment for the duration of your stay. Insurance must be purchased from a company registered in Ukraine or a foreign company that has a representative office or an insurance partner in Ukraine. Transiting travellers are exempt from self-isolation and installing the Vdoma application. <br>
Travellers arriving in Ukraine or crossing the administrative points from non-government-controlled parts of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts and Crimea will be subject to health monitoring on arrival. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities. <br>
Further information about visiting Ukraine during the quarantine period can be found at the Ukrainian authorities’ <a href=""https://visitukraine.today/"">Visit Ukraine webpage</a> .
*Exemptions: According to the resolution 1236 (9 December 2020) of the Ukrainian Government (Cabinet of Ministers), as updated on 25 October 2021, certain categories of foreign nationals are exempt from the insurance, PCR/RAT/express testing or vaccination requirements, and do not have to install the “Vdoma” app. These categories include foreign nationals who are: <br>
•        recognised as refugees <br>
•        accredited diplomats in Ukraine, or members of accredited diplomats’ families; <br>
•        air, sea, and land transport crews, or <br>
•        military personnel from NATO or “Partnership for Peace” countries taking part in exercises with the Ukrainian military <br>
Foreign nationals who are permanent residents of Ukraine are exempt from the insurance and PCR/RAT testing requirement, though they must provide a document confirming receipt of one or more doses of a recognised COVID-19 vaccine. <br>
The final decision on a person’s eligibility to enter Ukraine rests with the Ukrainian State Border Service. The entry requirement policies of foreign governments are imposed and enforced at their discretion. <br>

Internal restrictions: <br>
*Travel in Ukraine: Although not widely enforced due to the ongoing war, you require a vaccine certificate or negative PCR or express-test taken within 72 hours of travel, if travelling inter-city (by train, bus or plane). <br>
*Quarantine measures: COVID-19 quarantine measures are theoretically in place until 31 August 2022, but have been suspended since the introduction of martial law. Masks are not obligatory, though they remain “recommended” in public places. <br>
*Accommodation: Hotel accommodation remains open under the present COVID-19 quarantine rules, but security and availability are severely affected by the ongoing invasion. Hostels may only open in yellow, orange or red zones if all staff and customers are vaccinated. Hotel restaurant facilities are subject to the same rules as other restaurants, and will likely require a vaccinate certificate or negative Covid test for all customers. When staying in a hotel, you must adhere to the overall rules regarding masks and minimum distancing. If possible, check in online in advance to avoid check-in queues at the hotel. <br>
