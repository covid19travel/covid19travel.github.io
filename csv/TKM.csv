International Restrictions: <br>
 *Entry to Turkmenistan: All international scheduled commercial flights to and from Turkmenistan have been suspended. <br>
At present, entry to Turkmenistan is prohibited except for Turkmen nationals and accredited diplomats, permanently registered foreigners and some employees of international companies and organisations. <br>
All citizens of foreign countries arriving into Turkmenistan must have a document confirming that they have been vaccinated against COVID-19, or a certificate confirming the presence of antibodies to COVID-19 (IgM, IgG). The vaccination document should confirm that the first vaccination dose was provided at least 42 days prior to arrival in Turkmenistan. If an individual cannot be vaccinated for health reasons, a medical certificate confirming this must be provided instead. <br>
All citizens of foreign countries arriving into Turkmenistan must also provide a PCR test certificate and details of testing undertaken for the presence of antibodies to COVID-19 (IgM/IgG). <br>
*Transiting Turkmenistan: It is not currently possible to transit Turkmenistan en route to another destination.
*Testing / screening on arrival: Everyone arriving into the country is tested for COVID-19. Regardless of whether the test is positive or negative, all arrivals will be placed into quarantine for 21 days. If, however, you can provide a certificate of vaccination against COVID-19, you may be allowed to follow different quarantine conditions. You should confirm the latest information with your Turkmen sponsor, or with the Turkmen Embassy where your visa was issued. <br>
*Demonstrating your COVID-19 status: Although we understand that the proof of COVID recovery and vaccination status is being accepted in practice, Turkmenistan has not yet officially confirmed this. We therefore recommend that you contact your nearest Turkmenistan embassy for advice on entry requirements. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination. <br>
*Quarantine requirements: Mandatory quarantine is in place for all arrivals from abroad for up to 21 days. You will need to complete quarantine in a state-run facility. <br>
*Testing on departure: Anyone wishing to leave the country must present a negative test certificate signed by a doctor within 24 hours of intended travel.
