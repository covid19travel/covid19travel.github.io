 International Restrictions: <br>
*All travellers: You will need a visa to enter or travel through Pakistan as a visitor. For further information consult the High Commission for Pakistan in your country. <br>
Passengers aged 12 and above require full vaccination against COVID-19 in order to undertake inbound flights to Pakistan. Some exemptions apply.
On 28 December 2022, the Government of Pakistan Border Health Services announced that 2% of passengers arriving on international flights will be randomly selected and tested for COVID-19. The test will be in the form of a lateral flow with those testing positive then receiving a PCR test. Anyone who tests positive will be advised to self-isolate for five days.
*If you’re transiting through Pakistan: Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination. Transiting through Pakistan is permitted for travellers who are fully vaccinated. <br>
Land Borders: The majority of Pakistan’s land borders are open. <br>
The Torkham border crossing with Afghanistan is open to those crossing with valid passports and Pakistan visas, which you can apply for on the <a href=""https://visa.nadra.gov.pk/"">Ministry of Interior website</a>. All borders with Afghanistan are liable to close at short notice and there have previously been reports of crowding and violence at open crossings. Those crossing into Pakistan may have to comply with coronavirus testing and quarantine. <br>
Illegal entry to Pakistan is a serious offence. If you cross from Afghanistan without the correct documentation you may be subject to detention and/or deportation. There is currently no process for regularisation of status for illegal entrants, which is necessary for onward travel. <br>
*If you’re fully vaccinated: Pakistan accepts vaccines which are currently on the <a href=""https://www.who.int/teams/regulation-prequalification/eul/covid-19"">WHO Emergency Use Listing</a>. On 24 February 2022 Pakistan removed the requirement for a negative COVID-19 PCR test for vaccinated travellers entering the country. <br>
Travellers to Pakistan are no longer required to provide their contact information through the Pass Track App. You may have to fill in a health declaration form on arrival. Pakistan government guidance is available on their <a href=""https://covid.gov.pk/travel-guidelines"">COVID-19 website</a>.
Proof of vaccination status: Passengers aged 12 and above must present proof that they have been fully vaccinated to take inbound flights to Pakistan. <br>
Pakistan will accept the proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
*If you’re not fully vaccinated: Non-vaccinated passengers who are aged 12 years and above are required to possess a negative PCR test result conducted within 72 hours prior to commencing travel to Pakistan, unless one of the exemptions apply.<br>
*Children and young people: Children below 12 years of age do not need to show proof of vaccination to enter Pakistan. <br>
*Exemptions to Vaccination Rules: Exemptions to the vaccination rules may apply for: <br>
•        Passengers who hold a medical certificate stating that they have been medically advised not to receive a COVID-19 vaccine <br>
•        Passengers who travelled outbound from Pakistan before 1 October 2021 who have connecting flights in Pakistan. <br>
If one of these exemptions apply, you are required to present evidence of a negative COVID-19 PCR test taken up to 72 hours before the start of travel. <br>
Partial, or non-vaccinated travellers seeking further exemption from the vaccination or PCR testing requirement may apply through the relevant Pakistani High Commission to an Exemptions Committee for inbound travel to Pakistan. <br>

Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Travel in Pakistan: Public transport has restarted across Pakistan with some restrictions. Domestic flight operations have restarted at all airports in Pakistan. <br>
From 1 October, passengers who are aged 18 and above will require a full course of a Covid-19 vaccine in order to undertake domestic air travel in Pakistan. Pakistan will accept the  proof of vaccination certificate. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
Passengers who are exempt from this requirement are: <bt>
•        Foreign passport holders below 18 years of age <br>
•        Passengers who hold a medical certificate stating that they have been medically advised not to receive a Covid-19 vaccine <br>
*Travel to the airport: You’re strongly advised not to travel to the airport if you’re displaying any COVID-19 symptoms, including a high temperature. When you enter the airport, you may be thermal scanned by the Pakistani authorities. If you have a high temperature or other COVID-19 symptoms, you will not be permitted to fly and may be asked to self-isolate for 14 days before you can travel. <br>
*Public places and services: Pakistani authorities have used a range of measures on public activities to prevent the spread of COVID-19 including requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccination, bans on indoor and outdoor dining, restrictions on commercial activities, educational institutes and gatherings. Restrictions may be lifted or re-imposed based on the levels of COVID-19 in the country. <br>
There are mandatory standard operating procedures which must be followed in public spaces, including the use of face masks, temperature screening and social distancing. Across Pakistan, it is now mandatory to wear a face mask in public and not wearing one is punishable by a fine. <br>
There are additional varying measures in force in each province including compulsory self-isolation for people who have COVID-19 symptoms, or people who have come into contact with others with COVID-19 symptoms. In some cases, authorities are locking down specific areas. Some provinces have introduced powers to fine or arrest anyone breaking the rules. You should follow the federal and relevant provincial guidance, and monitor local media for updates. Plan any movements accordingly. <br>
*At the airport: You must wear a face mask at the airport. You will need to bring your own mask with you. Airlines and airport authorities will not provide masks. <br>
The Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) require the plane to be disinfected prior to departing for Pakistan. Luggage will also be disinfected before it is loaded onto the plane. Cabin Crew will be required to wear personal protective equipment (PPE). <br>
*If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
