 Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Travel in Austria: FFP2 face masks are compulsory on public transport and inside taxis. <br>
*Public spaces and services: Regional COVID measures vary. Check regional rules before you travel. FFP2 facemasks are compulsory in some public spaces such as supermarkets, banks and petrol stations. <br>
*Testing positive for COVID-19 in Austria: If you get a positive PCR test result, you will have to self-isolate immediately. You should contact the health authorities for further instructions by calling 1450.<br>
If you test positive with a lateral flow test, you will be treated as a “suspected case” and must self-isolate immediately, following the instructions of the health authorities. A lateral flow test will usually be followed up with a PCR test. If the PCR test is negative, you can leave self-isolation.<br>
Options for self-isolation vary by region. In Vienna, a free hotel is available for visitors who test positive and have nowhere else to self-isolate.<br>
Rules for ending self-isolation after a confirmed infection vary by region and may require a negative PCR test. They should be communicated to you as part of the official order to self-isolate (“Absonderungsbescheid”).
