•    2G (vaccinated, recovered): Guests provide proof of their vaccination status or a medical certificate showing recovery from infection in the past 180 days as confirmed by a molecular biological (e.g. PCR) test. The austria.info website explains the rules for approved vaccine doses and recovery. <br>
•    2,5G (vaccinated, recovered, tested): Guests provide proof of their vaccination status, a medical certificate showing recovery from infection or a molecular biological (e.g.PCR) test. The test cannot be older than 72 hours (no older than 48 hours in Vienna). The austria.info website explains the rules for approved vaccines, recovery and tests. <br>
•    3G (vaccinated, recovered, tested or negative antigen test). Guests provide proof of their vaccination status, a medical certificate showing recovery from infection, a molecular biological (e.g. PCR) test or a negative antigen test.
