 Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Travel in Austria: FFP2 face masks are compulsory in all enclosed spaces including on public transport and inside taxis. <br>
*Public spaces and services: FFP2 facemasks are compulsory in all enclosed spaces. When two metre social distancing is not possible, FFP2 masks are also compulsory outdoors. <br>
Regional COVID measures vary, including whether non-essential shops, hotels, restaurants, bars and cultural institutions are open. Many places require evidence of vaccination or recovery to enter. Check regional rules before you travel. <br>
*Lockdown for unvaccinated people: For people who are not fully vaccinated, the only valid reasons to leave the home include to avoid immediate danger or harm to oneself or one´s possessions, to seek medical attention (including vaccinations), for education or work purposes (though working from home is recommended where possible), to exercise for physical or mental health, and to purchase essentials such as food or medicine. <br>
*Testing positive for COVID-19 in Austria: If you get a positive PCR test result, you will have to self-isolate immediately. You should contact the health authorities for further instructions by calling 1450. <br>
If you test positive with a lateral flow test, you will be treated as a “suspected case” and must self-isolate immediately, following the instructions of the health authorities. A lateral flow test will usually be followed up with a PCR test. If the PCR test is negative, you can leave self-isolation. <br>
Options for self-isolation vary by region. In Vienna, a free hotel is available for visitors who test positive and have nowhere else to self-isolate. A doctor can provide a letter allowing you to leave Austria by private car. <br>
