 Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Travel in Austria: FFP2 face masks are compulsory in all enclosed spaces including on public transport and inside taxis. <br>
Public spaces and services: Regional COVID measures vary. Check regional rules before you travel. FFP2 facemasks are generally compulsory in indoor spaces as well as public transport, in shops and when entering restaurants and for physical services. <br>
Testing positive for COVID-19 in Austria: If you get a positive PCR test result, you will have to self-isolate immediately. You should contact the health authorities for further instructions by calling 1450. <br>
If you test positive with a lateral flow test, you will be treated as a “suspected case” and must self-isolate immediately, following the instructions of the health authorities. A lateral flow test will usually be followed up with a PCR test. If the PCR test is negative, you can leave self-isolation. <br>
Options for self-isolation vary by region. In Vienna, a free hotel is available for visitors who test positive and have nowhere else to self-isolate. <br>
Rules for ending self-isolation after a confirmed infection vary by region and may require a negative PCR test. They should be communicated to you as part of the official order to self-isolate (“Absonderungsbescheid”). <br>
*If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
