been vaccinated against COVID-19 (vaccine type and manufacturer, number of doses, date of vaccination);<br>
received a negative test result, PCR or rapid antigen, with the name of the test, date and time of test, test centre and result (self-tests are not valid);<br>
recovered from COVID-19 (positive PCR test result valid for 180 days).<br>
When travelling, holders of the EU Digital COVID Certificate will have the same rights as citizens of the visited Member State who have been vaccinated, tested or recovered.<br><br>

You do not need to take a second test or avoid contact with others if you are fully vaccinated against Covid-19, or when you have recovered from COVID-19 within the past six months.","Latest News: Authorities extend travel restrictions until 31 January (SVI, 15.01.2022).
