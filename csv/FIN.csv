","THIS COUNTRY IS READY TO CONNECT TO THE EU DIGITAL COVID CERTIFICATE GATEWAY <br>
The EU Digital COVID Certificate (available as of 1 July 2021) provides proof that a person has either: <br>
been vaccinated against COVID-19 (vaccine type and manufacturer, number of doses, date of vaccination);<br>
received a negative test result, PCR or rapid antigen, with the name of the test, date and time of test, test centre and result (self-tests are not valid);<br>
recovered from COVID-19 (positive PCR test result valid for 180 days).<br>
When travelling, holders of the EU Digital COVID Certificate will have the same rights as citizens of the visited Member State who have been vaccinated, tested or recovered.<br><br>

A 14-day period of self-isolation is recommended for travellers arriving in Finland from high-incidence countries. Travellers can shorten their self-isolation period if they take two COVID-19 tests, and the results are negative. The tests are necessary even if you have received two doses of corona vaccine. You do not need to take a second test or avoid contact with others if you are fully vaccinated against Covid-19, or when you have recovered from COVID-19 within the past six months.","Latest News: Finnish authorities lift entry restrictions for non-vaccinated arrivals from several third countries; restrictions for most other non-vaccinated travelers from outside Europe extended (SVI, 05.11.2021)
