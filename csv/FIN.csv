*Transit: <p><strong>YES</strong></p><p>Transit on scheduled routes is permitted. As a rule, during the transit journey, a person must remain in the transit area of the airport. In exceptional cases, transit travellers may also be permitted to enter the country. For example, a person may stay at a hotel near the airport if the waiting time for a connecting flight is too long. Destination countries may also require passengers to take a coronavirus test at transit airports. Waiting for the test and the test results is not in itself a ground for allowing entry during transit.</p>
