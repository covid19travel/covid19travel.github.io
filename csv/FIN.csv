In exceptional cases, transit travellers may also be permitted to enter the country. For example, a person may stay at a hotel near the airport if the waiting time for a connecting flight is too long. Destination countries may also require passengers to take a coronavirus test at transit airports. Waiting for the test and the test results is not in itself a ground for allowing entry during transit.

Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Travel in Finland: The Finnish authorities introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus. These measures include more stringent controls on people arriving from abroad. See the 
<a href=""https://raja.fi/en/guidelines-for-border-traffic-during-pandemic"">Finnish Border Guard website</a>  for more details. From 29 March, this will include the right to order a compulsory health examination, which could include a COVID-19 test, on arrival.<br>
