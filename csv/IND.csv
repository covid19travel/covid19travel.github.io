*If you’re fully vaccinated:<br>
Pre-boarding:  All travellers should submit a self-declaration form on the online <a href=""https://www.newdelhiairport.in/"">“Air Suvidha” portal</a> before scheduled travel.

The requirement for a COVID-19 RT-PCR test on the 8th day of arrival in India has also been removed. The only requirement on arrival currently is to self-monitor for 14 days. Other requirements may be introduced at short notice. More information and detailed guidance is available on the website of <a href=""https://www.civilaviation.gov.in/"">Ministry of Civil Aviation</a>.
Some travellers may be subject to random testing on arrival in airports, and if you test positive, you may be subject to institutional quarantine. <br>
All passengers will also be subject to thermal screening. If symptomatic, you may be isolated and taken to a medical facility. You may be asked to present your self-declaration form, vaccination certificate or negative RT-PCR report to airport staff. <br>

Travelling parents/guardians should note that it may not always be possible for parents to have access to the child/children during their period of isolation. This guidance applies across India. <br>
If you’re transiting through India: Since the requirement for on-arrival testing has been removed for those who are fully vaccinated, there is no requirement for you to quarantine before transiting.
