Please note that Ecuador’s National Emergency Operations Committee (COE) only makes recommendations, but the power to impose these restrictions rests with local authorities. As a result, you may see some discrepancies between local areas. Municipality authorities will decide whether to enforce the COE’s announcement of 28 April 2022 regarding the optional use of masks in public spaces. Quito municipality has stated they will align to the COE’s resolution on the use of masks, but highly recommend its use in public indoor spaces. Further local restrictions, including vehicle circulation restrictions, are responsibility of each local authority.
