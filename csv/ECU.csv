 International Restrictions: <br>
*All travellers: All passengers are required to complete a  <a href=""https://declaracionsalud-viajero.msp.gob.ec/"">Health Declaration Form  </a> with their itinerary and local contact details. <br>
As of October 2021, international cruise ship operations are authorised at the following ports: Esmeraldas, Manta, Guayaquil and Puerto Bolivar. However, there are strict guidelines and measures to comply with to obtain the relevant permissions. <br>
Quarantine requirements: If you have COVID-19 symptoms on arrival, you may be required to take a rapid antigen test. If the result is positive, you will be instructed to self-isolate for 7 days. <br>
If you are non-residents, you will have to self-isolate in a hotel at your own expense. You will have to give the contact number and full address where you will self-isolate on your Health Status Declaration Form. Compliance with the isolation requirement and your state of health will be monitored via telephone calls. If you are a resident, you can self-isolate at home. <br>
The Ministry of Public Health has published more information on <a href=""https://coronavirusecuador.com/"">coronavirus protocols and direct contact options  </a> (Spanish only).
*If you’re fully vaccinated: If you are fully vaccinated, you can enter Ecuador. At least 14 days must have passed since your second dose of the vaccine, and the vaccine must be approved by the <a href=""https://www.who.int/teams/regulation-prequalification/eul/covid-19"">World Health Organisation</a>.
Proof of vaccination status: Ecuador will accept the proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
*If you’re not fully vaccinated: If you are not fully vaccinated you must present a laboratory PCR test, taken up to 72 hours prior to boarding your flight, in order to enter Ecuador. <br>
Passengers arriving from countries whose regulations state that COVID-19 vaccination is available only after 6 months of having been infected, and who are thus unable to show their full vaccination certificate, will be required to present together with their COVID-19 infection certificate, an official document proving the above dispensation and regulation (valid for 6 months).<br>
*If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year
If you are not fully vaccinated but have tested positive for COVID-19 in the last year, you can enter Ecuador. You will need to show evidence of a positive laboratory PCR test (taken more than 14 days and less than a year ago). <br>
Visitors previously diagnosed with COVID-19 and who continue to test positive with a laboratory PCR test after a month, should present a medical certificate issued in the country of origin which indicates that they are non-infectious. This will be accepted as long as they are no longer showing symptoms.<br>
*Children and young people: Children under 3 years old do not need to show proof of vaccination or a negative PCR test for entry into Ecuador. <br>
Children between 3 and 16 years old must submit either their full COVID-19 vaccination certificate, with at least 14 days validity, or a negative laboratory PCR test taken 72 hours before the flight.<br>
Travel to and from the Galapagos Islands: Travellers over 3 years old must present a full COVID-19 vaccination certificate or a negative laboratory PCR/antigen test taken 72 hours before their flight to the Galapagos. For inter-island travel, all passengers over 12 years must present their complete vaccination certificate. <br>
*If you’re transiting through Ecuador: If you are transiting through Ecuador, you are subject to the same COVID-19 requirements as for entering Ecuador.
*Exemptions: Airline crew members are exempt from Ecuador’s current entry requirements.<br>
<br>
<br>
 Internal Restrictions: <br> 
*Travel in Ecuador: The Ecuadorean government provides coronavirus-related information on the <a href=""https://www.coronavirusecuador.com/"">Coronavirus Ecuador website</a>. The Ministry of Public Health (MSP) also provides an <a href=""https://www.salud.gob.ec/coronavirus-covid-19/"">information page</a>. However, the most up to date information is accessible via their <a href=""https://twitter.com/salud_ec"">Twitter account</a>. <br>
*Restrictions: The general nationwide biosecurity measures include: <br>
•        mandatory COVID-19 vaccination for Ecuadorean nationals and foreign residents<br>
•        as of 28 April 2022, the use of masks is no longer mandatory in public spaces (both indoors and out). However, private establishments may impose their own biosecurity rules and request the use of masks. We recommend you carry a mask together with your proof of vaccination<br>
•        the land border with Colombia is open for all travellers via the Rumichaca international border crossing, from 8am to 5pm<br>
•        the land border with Peru re-opened on 18 February 2022 for all travellers via the Huaquillas and Macará international border crossings, from 8am to 5pm<br>
•        most ports remain closed for travel/tourism activities. As of October 2021, international cruise ship operations are permitted in Esmeraldas, Guayaquil, Manta and Puerto Baquerizo ports<br>
All people over 12 (including foreign tourists) must present their COVID-19 vaccination certificate (showing 2 complete doses) to enter establishments providing non-essential services (for example, but not limited to, shops, supermarkets, restaurants, transport, etc). This rule has also been enforced at airports. This will not apply to public sector institutions and for essential services such as health and education. COVID-19 vaccination certificates are also mandatory for all passengers over 5 years old for all inter-district, interstate, urban and tourist buses.<br>
Please note that Ecuador’s National Emergency Operations Committee (COE) only makes recommendations, but the power to impose these restrictions rests with local authorities. As a result, you may see some discrepancies between local areas. Municipality authorities will decide whether to enforce the COE’s announcement of 28 April 2022 regarding the optional use of masks in public spaces. Quito municipality has stated they will align to the COE’s resolution on the use of masks, but highly recommend its use in public indoor spaces. Further local restrictions, including vehicle circulation restrictions, are responsibility of each local authority. The most up to date information can be found via the local authorities’ social media channels:<br>
