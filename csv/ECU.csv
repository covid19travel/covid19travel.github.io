The state of emergency for the provinces of Azuay, El Oro, Esmeraldas, Guayas, Loja, Manabi, Pichincha and Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas, ended on 9 April 2021. However, the National Emergency Operations Committee made a recommendation in their resolution of 14 April, that these provinces, plus those of Santa Elena, Los Rios and Zamora, should consider restricting vehicle circulation from 8pm to 5am from 16 April to 2 May. They also recommended that the Ministry of Education should suspend in-person classes in all these provinces due to the increased number of COVID-19 cases reported.<br>
COE´s resolution of 14 April also recommends a further traffic restriction along national highways, from Friday to Sunday between 8pm and 5am, during the whole month of April.<br>
The above vehicle restrictions do not apply for key sectors such as public and private healthcare, security, basic public services, emergency response, produce sectors and those who need to transport goods and food; people who are transporting passengers to/from the airport (showing flight tickets) and for verified medical emergencies and appointments are also exempt.<br>
*Restrictions: The central government´s “red, amber, green” alert system is no longer in force. However, it will be used as an internal management tool for epidemiological monitoring.<br>
Each municipal government is responsible for determining its own specific restrictions including, but not limited to, maximum capacity for public transport and institutions, operations capacity of private businesses, the circulation of private vehicles against licence plate numbers, health prevention protocols for all businesses and industries and alcohol consumption. <br>
We recommend you follow the local municipalities’ social media channels to obtain the most up to date notifications, but bear in mind that these might change at any time: <br>
