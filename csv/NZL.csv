 *Quarantine requirements: Anyone entering New Zealand needs to undergo quarantine or managed isolation in an approved facility for a minimum of 14 days. Arrivals must then test negative for COVID-19 before entering the community.
 Anyone travelling to New Zealand will be required to have a COVID-19 test on ‘day zero’, i.e. within 24 hours of arrival in a managed isolation and quarantine facility. Arrivals must remain in their managed isolation or quarantine facility room until the results of the test is known. You will then undergo further testing on Day 3 and Day 12 as required for all arrivals, in line with New Zealand’s policy on isolation and quarantine. Travellers to New Zealand will need to register on the Managed Isolation Allocation System as the first step to securing their place in a managed isolation facility. Before you book your flights, you need to register for a voucher for managed isolation. Your voucher allocates you a place in a managed isolation facility.
 For more information see <a href=""https://www.miq.govt.nz/travel-to-new-zealand/secure-your-place-in-managed-isolation/"">Secure your place in managed isolation</a>. Provision of a voucher for managed isolation does not guarantee entry into New Zealand. You must first ensure you qualify to enter the country under New Zealand’s border restrictions. You can apply for your MIQ voucher up to 3 months in advance. New Zealand government is asking prospective travellers to regularly check the <a href=""https://allocation.miq.govt.nz/portal/"">Managed Isolation Allocation System</a> website for preferred dates. There are a few exceptional circumstances in which people can apply for an exemption from managed isolation. Visit the <a href=""https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-current-situation/covid-19-border-controls"">New Zealand Ministry of Health website</a> for more information.
