All non-New Zealand citizens must hold a valid visa to enter New Zealand. Other travellers, including New Zealand residents, can enter only if they spend 14 days outside a very high risk country before their arrival here. Transit through a very high risk country is excluded from the 14-day requirement.

*Quarantine free travel: For New Zealand, quarantine-free travel is available on commercial aircraft only. It is currently with Australia and the Cook Islands only.

*Quarantine requirements:  Anyone entering New Zealand (except from within a quarantine-free travel bubble, currently arranged with Australia and the Cook Islands) needs to undergo quarantine or managed isolation in an approved facility for a minimum of 14 days. Arrivals must then test negative for COVID-19 before entering the community. From 19 April 2021 travellers who have been in Australia for 14 days can travel by air to New Zealand without having to enter a managed isolation facility. Please see the New Zealand government COVID-19 website for details. Anyone travelling to New Zealand (except travel from within a quarantine-free travel bubble) will be required to have a COVID-19 test on ‘day zero’, i.e. within 24 hours of arrival in a managed isolation and quarantine facility. Arrivals must remain in their managed isolation or quarantine facility room until the results of the test is known. You will then undergo further testing on Day 3 and Day 12 as required for all arrivals, in line with New Zealand’s policy on isolation and quarantine. Travellers to New Zealand will need to register on the Managed Isolation Allocation System as the first step to securing their place in a managed isolation facility. Before you book your flights, you need to register for a voucher for managed isolation. Your voucher allocates you a place in a managed isolation facility. For more information see <a href=""https://www.miq.govt.nz/travel-to-new-zealand/secure-your-place-in-managed-isolation/"">‘Secure your place in managed isolation’</a>. Provision of a voucher for managed isolation does not guarantee entry into New Zealand. You must first ensure you qualify to enter the country under New Zealand’s border restrictions. You can apply for your MIQ voucher in advance. Space in managed isolation is limited and the New Zealand government is asking prospective travellers to regularly check the <a href=""https://allocation.miq.govt.nz/portal/"">Managed Isolation Allocation System</a> website for preferred dates. There are a few exceptional circumstances in which people can apply for an exemption from managed isolation. Visit the <a href=""https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-current-situation/covid-19-border-controls"">New Zealand Ministry of Health website</a> for more information.
