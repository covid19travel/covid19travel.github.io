International Restrictions: <br>
*All travellers: Following the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions on 13 September 2022, there are no longer any requirements for travellers to be fully vaccinated in order to travel to New Zealand. However, some travel providers might have in place certain requirements for passengers to travel with them, so please consult your travel provider’s website for further information. <br>
Eligible travellers entering New Zealand will also be given a pack of rapid antigen tests (RATs) with <a href=""https://covid19.govt.nz/international-travel/travel-to-new-zealand/testing-requirements-after-arriving-in-new-zealand/"">instructions </a> at the airport. Travellers are encouraged to test on day 0/1 and 5/6. Please see <a href=""https://covid19.govt.nz/international-travel/travel-to-new-zealand/when-new-zealand-borders-open/#self-isolation-requirements"">New Zealand Government COVID-19</a> for full details. <br>
You do not need a visa to enter New Zealand as a visitor for up to 6 months, but you will need to get a New Zealand Electronic Travel Authority (NZeTA) before you travel. <br>
The NZeTA costs NZD $9 if applying via the dedicated mobile app, or NZD $12 if completed online. You will also need to pay an International Visitor Conservation and Tourism Levy (IVL) of NZD $35 when you apply. Once issued, the NZeTA is valid for up to two years. The New Zealand immigration authorities recommend that applicants allow up to 72 hours for processing. <br>
On arrival in New Zealand, you will also need to satisfy the Immigration Officer that you meet the criteria for visa-free entry, which includes having an onward ticket and sufficient funds to support you during your stay. You can check the full criteria on the New Zealand Immigration website. New Zealand’s immigration rules are strict, particularly regarding employment. Visitors cannot work in New Zealand. <br>
For more information about visas, visit the <a href=""https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas"">New Zealand Immigration website  </a> or contact the nearest <a href=""https://www.mfat.govt.nz/en/embassies"">New Zealand High Commission</a>.
*If you’re transiting through New Zealand: Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination. <br>
If you are planning to transit through New Zealand to another country you must request an NZeTA before you travel. You must ensure you hold the necessary entry documentation for your final destination and the other countries which you will transit through. <br>
In most cases, transit passengers must hold an Electronic Travel Authority (ETA) or transit ETA before travel. These are applied for online. See <a href=""https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas/apply-for-a-visa/about-visa/nzeta"">Information about NZeTA  </a>   for further detail.<br>

However, the New Zealand COVID-19 Tracer app is still available to download for this purpose with many shops and businesses displaying their QR codes for scanning. You can find out more about scanning and contact tracing <a href=https://covid19.govt.nz/testing-and-tracing/"""">here</a>.
Range of measures that can be applied locally or nationally: COVID-19 public health measures and restrictions may be applied at a town, city, territorial local authority, regional or national level. <br>
New Zealand currently has minimal COVID-19 requirements around mask use and only those who test positive for COVID-19 are required to isolate. You can check restrictions and health updates on the <a href=""https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus"">New Zealand Ministry of Health website</a>.
