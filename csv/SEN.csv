International Restrictions: 
*Some flights to and from Dakar Blaise Diagne International airport have been cancelled as a result of the ongoing civil unrest. Borders re-opened for international flights in mid-July. Land and sea borders remain closed except the Senegal-Gambia border which is now open. The majority of international airlines have resumed commercial routes. <br>
*Entry to Senegal: The government of Senegal has said airlines are not allowed to carry foreign nationals from countries who have put in place travel restrictions for Senegal unless they are ordinarily resident in Senegal, diplomats, military, health professionals and other specific professional categories. <br>
Despite this, some airlines are only allowing foreign nationals with proof of residency in Senegal to travel. It is important to note that some airlines only accept a full residency card, and not a ‘récépissé’, although the government of Senegal have confirmed that a ‘récépissé’ is proof of residency. You should check with your airline before travelling. <br>
Several airlines are now requesting a letter of support from Senegalese Embassies before boarding flights to Senegal. To enter Senegal, you must provide a negative test dated no more than 5 days earlier, issued in the country where you started your trip and authorised by that country or a recognised health organisation. <br>
You must also complete and submit a ‘Public Health Passenger Locator’ form on arrival in Senegal. You’ll need to submit this form at border control. You can access the form on the <a href=""https://www.dakaraeroport.com/formulaire-de-localisation-de-passager-pour-la-sante-publique/"">Dakar Airport website</a>.

Masks must be worn at all times in public areas and when travelling, including in a private car if there are two or more people in the car. <br>
*Accommodation: Hotels are open. <br>
*Public places and services: Masks must be worn in all public areas throughout Senegal, including in supermarkets, on public transport (which is still operating with reduced capacity), in taxis, and when on public streets.
