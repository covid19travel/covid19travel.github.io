The testing and quarantine requirement does not apply to persons who have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 in the last twelve months, or who have recovered from COVID-19 in the last 180 days and who have been declared healthy by a doctor.<br>
The EU Digital COVID Certificate (available as of 1 July 2021) provides proof that a person has either: <br>
been vaccinated against COVID-19 (vaccine type and manufacturer, number of doses, date of vaccination);<br>
received a negative test result, PCR or rapid antigen, with the name of the test, date and time of test, test centre and result (self-tests are not valid);<br>
recovered from COVID-19 (positive PCR test result valid for 180 days).<br>
When travelling, holders of the EU Digital COVID Certificate will have the same rights as citizens of the visited Member State who have been vaccinated, tested or recovered.<br><br>

Provisions for vaccinated people: The testing and quarantine requirement does not apply to persons who have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 in the last twelve months, or who have recovered from COVID-19 in the last 180 days and who have been declared healthy by a doctor.","Latest News: Authorities impose tighter entry rules for travelers from European member states; impose quarantine for arrivals from some African countries (SVI, 07.12.2021)
