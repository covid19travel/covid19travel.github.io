Internations Restrictions:<br>
 *Entry to Cameroon: There are multiple commercial flight options to enter and leave Cameroon.  Access across Cameroon’s land and sea borders is currently restricted due to COVID-19. <br>
Travel requirements to enter and exit Cameroon can change without notice and without proactive communication. The Centre for the Coordination of Public Health Emergency Operations conditions of entry and exit to Cameroon <a href=""https://www.ccousp.cm/urgences-sanitaires/Fcovid-19/condition-dentree-et-sortie-au-cameroun/"">website</a> is the best source of the latest information. <br>
If you have proof of your COVID-19 vaccination, you are no longer required to present a negative PCR test to enter Cameroon. <br>
If you do not have proof of your COVID-19 vaccination, you must provide a recent (no older than 72 hours before first boarding) negative coronavirus PCR test to board your flight to Cameroon and to enter at Yaoundé or Douala Airports. <br>
The Government of Cameroon demands a negative Coronavirus PCR test from all travellers aged five and above if you are not vaccinated against COVID-19. (Some airlines demand a PCR test from travellers aged two and above, so check with your airline.) <br>
Negative coronavirus test results should be in PDF format, clearly stating the date of the test and the type of test. Electronic copies are accepted. You should arrange to take a private test. <br>
Testing/screening on arrival: All international travellers are subjected to rapid flow testing for Coronavirus on arrival at Yaoundé and Douala international airports. These tests are compulsory. Results are returned while passengers are at the airport. There is no fee.
*Quarantine requirements: If you have a proof of a recent (no older than 72 hours before boarding) negative coronavirus test, you will normally not have to self-isolate. Anyone that has developed symptoms of Coronavirus on their travel or tests positive on arrival at Yaoundé or Douala airport will be held for further enquiries to trace contacts and movements. We believe that anyone testing positive can quarantine at the location of your host or private accommodation until a negative PCR test is produced. These requirements are regularly evolving. <br>
Exit requirements: Negative PCR certificates are no longer required for all passengers leaving Cameroon, and are only necessary if it is the requirement of your country of destination. Call 1506 for any complaints regarding airport checks. <br>
If you require a PCR test to leave Cameroon, you will be charged a standard rate of FCFA 30,000. You can request and pay for a test <a href=""https://tresorpublic.cm/en/services/minsantecovid19"">online</a> . You can also pay in-person at various sites including: the National Public Health Laboratory in Yaoundé, the Laquintinie Hospital in Douala and the Regional Hospital Centre in Garoua. For further information on the testing process, you should call 1510. Your country of destination or transit may have other requirements. <br>
Travellers leaving Cameroon are frequently asked for their Yellow Fever certificate as they pass through security. You should carry it with you as you pass through the airport.<br>

  <br> 
  Internal Restrictions: <br>
 *Public places and services: Restrictions on bars, restaurants and entertainment spots have been lifted.
The wearing of face-masks has almost entirely been dropped, including in public buildings. However, you should carry one on you in case needed. <br>
*If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.","<a href=""https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/cameroon"">Foreign travel advice, Gov.UK</a>/
