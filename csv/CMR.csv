This is the Rapid Flow test. At present this includes all passengers arriving from Europe, including the UK. These tests are compulsory. Results are returned while passengers are at the airport. There is no fee. This is in addition to the requirement to have a negative test 72 hours before embarkation on the first leg of your journey to Cameroon. <br>
