Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Travel in France: From Monday 16 May, wearing masks on public transport is no longer compulsory, although some towns and cities may require mask wearing on public transport. You should check local mask rules before you travel. Wearing masks on public transport remains recommended, especially for vulnerable people. <br>
Some travel operators such as airlines may specify types of masks to be worn on board e.g. surgical masks, and may encourage you to take spares for long journeys. Please check with your travel operator before travelling. <br>
There are no internal travel restrictions in France; however, measures may change at short notice either at national or at local level. You should visit the <a href=""https://www.gouvernement.fr/info-coronavirus"">French Government Coronavirus Information page</a> or use the ‘TousAntiCovid’ digital app for further information and to stay up to date on restrictions. <br>
*Public spaces and services: Face masks are mandatory in all health establishments (hospitals, clinics, retirement homes, nursing homes and assisted living, as well as establishments for people with disabilities).<br>
Pass sanitaire (health pass)
The pass sanitaire is currently required to access the following places:<br>
•        Hospitals, clinics, social/medical health care establishments
•        Retirement homes, nursing homes, independent and assisted-living residences <br>
•        Establishments for people with disabilities <br>
You can find more information on requirements and how to 
<a href=""https://www.gouvernement.fr/info-coronavirus/pass-sanitaire"">access the “pass sanitaire” from the French Government</a>.
You can get the pass sanitaire by fulfilling one of the following three criteria: <br>
1.        A vaccination certificate (see details on proof of vaccination below), or <br>
2.        A negative PCR or antigen result from a test taken within the last 24 hours, or <br>
3.        A document (dated more than 11 days ago and less than six months ago) proving you have recently recovered from COVID. <br>
Children under 12 are exempt from ‘pass sanitaire’ requirements.<br>
Proof of vaccination: The French Government recognises vaccination certificates that conform to EU norms. This means: <br>
•        7 days after a third dose of Oxford/AstraZeneca,  Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, and Novavax for domestic use (to obtain a valid “health pass”), or <br>
•        28 days after a second dose of Johnson & Johnson, or <br>
•        7 days after a second injection for those able to demonstrate they have already been infected (this only applies to those vaccinated in France) for domestic use (to obtain a valid “vaccine pass”) <br>
Since 15 February 2022, anyone aged over 18 years and 1 month needs to have received a booster dose within 4 months of the initial course (or after infection for those vaccinated in France) to be considered fully vaccinated for domestic purposes (i.e. to use the pass sanitaire). If the pass deactivates because you have not received a booster within 4 months of the initial course, you can reactivate it by receiving a booster dose. <br>
France will accept the proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
Those vaccinated in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland can also choose to scan and save the QR code into France’s “TousAntiCovid” app. <br>
*If you test positive for COVID-19 in France and you’re fully vaccinated (including a booster) or if you’ve had COVID-19 in the last 4 months, you must self-isolate for 7 days from the day on which you first develop symptoms, or 7 days from the date of the positive test result. Self-isolation can be reduced to 5 days if you take a negative PCR or antigen test (supervised, not self-administered) on day 5 and you have not displayed any symptoms over the previous 48 hours. These isolation rules also apply to children under the age of 12, regardless of their vaccination status.  Further information is available on the TousAntiCovid application. The French health ministry also operates a dedicated coronavirus helpline on +33 (0)800 130 000.
