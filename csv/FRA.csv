Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Travel in France: Wearing masks on public transport is compulsory for all users aged 11 and over, with fines for those who are not compliant. Masks are also compulsory in taxis and private hire vehicles without a plexiglass screen. <br>
Some travel operators such as airlines may specify types of masks to be worn on board e.g. surgical masks, and may encourage you to take spares for long journeys. Please check with your travel operator before travelling.
There are no internal travel restrictions in France, however measures may change at short notice either at national or at local level. You should visit the <a href=""https://www.gouvernement.fr/info-coronavirus"">French government Coronavirus Information page</a> or use the ‘TousAntiCovid’ digital app for further information and to stay up to date on restrictions. <br>
*Public spaces and services: Face masks are mandatory on public transport and in all health establishments (hospitals, clinics, retirement homes, nursing homes and assisted living, as well as establishments for people with disabilities). <br>
*Pass sanitaire: The pass sanitaire is currently required to access the following places: <br>
•        Hospitals, clinics, social/medical health care establishments <br>
•        Retirement homes, nursing homes, independent and assisted-living residences
•        Establishments for people with disabilities
You can find more information on requirements and how to <a href=""https://www.gouvernement.fr/info-coronavirus/pass-sanitaire"">access the “pass sanitaire” from the French government</a>.
This can be acquired by fulfilling one of the following three criteria:
1.        A vaccination certificate (see details on proof of vaccination below). <br>
2.        A negative PCR or antigen result from a test taken within the last 24 hours. <br>
3.        A document (dated more than 11 days ago and less than six months ago) proving you have recently recovered from COVID. <br>
Children under 12 are exempt from the ‘pass sanitaire’ requirements. <br>
Proof of vaccination: The French government recognises vaccination certificates, which conform to the EU Digital Covid Status Certification framework, illustrating that you are fully vaccinated with a vaccine authorised by the European Medical Authority. This means: <br>
•        7 days after a third dose of Oxford/AstraZeneca, Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, and Novavax for domestic use (to obtain a valid “vaccine pass”). <br>
•        28 days after a second dose of Johnson & Johnson. <br>
•        7 days after a second injection for those able to demonstrate they have already been infected (this only applies to those vaccinated in France) for domestic use (to obtain a valid “vaccine pass”). <br>
Since 15 February 2022, anyone aged over 18 years and 1 month needs to have received a booster vaccine within 4 months of their second dose (or after infection for those vaccinated in France) to be considered fully vaccinated. <br>
France will accept the proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. If you are travelling with a printed PDF proof of vaccination status, it must date from 1 November or after to ensure that the certificate can be scanned successfully, if domestic certification is required. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
Other Covid status certification that conforms with the EU Digital COVID Certification scheme (e.g. from other EU member states) can also be used for entry into settings where there is a COVID status certification requirement in France. <br>
*If you test positive for coronavirus in France and you’re fully vaccinated (including a booster) you must self-isolate for 7 days from the day on which you first develop symptoms, or 7 days from the date of the positive test result. Self-isolation can be reduced to 5 days if you take a negative PCR or antigen test (supervised, not self-administered) on day 5 and you have not displayed any symptoms over the previous 48 hours. If you’re unvaccinated or partially vaccinated you must self-isolate for 10 days from the day on which you first develop symptoms, or 10 days from the date of the positive test result. Self-isolation can be reduced to 7 days if you take a negative PCR or antigen test (supervised, not self-administered) on day 7 and you have not displayed any symptoms over the previous 48 hours. <br>
You will have to extend your stay until the end of your isolation period. This could be in your current accommodation. The French authorities do not provide or pay for quarantine accommodation. <br>
Further information is available on the TousAntiCovid application. The French health ministry also operates a dedicated coronavirus helpline on +33 (0)800 130 000.
