Only PCR tests will be accepted, meaning that those who hold a negative rapid antigen test or any other test will be denied entry to France.

Regarding arrivals from EU countries, the French authorities have announced that all nationals of the Members States and Andorra, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Norway, San Marino, the Vatican City State, and Switzerland can continue to enter France restriction-free as long as they hold a valid vaccination or recover certificate.

Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Travel in France: Face masks are mandatory in all enclosed public spaces. While it is no longer a requirement to wear a mask in all outdoor public spaces in France, it remains mandatory in a number of departments. Please check local guidance for more information. Across France, masks are still compulsory in large gatherings, queues, markets and stadiums. <br>
Wearing masks on public transport is compulsory for all users aged 11 and over, with fines for those who are not compliant. Masks are also compulsory in taxis and private hire vehicles without a plexiglass screen.<br>
Some travel operators such as airlines may specify types of masks to be worn on board e.g. surgical masks, and may encourage you to take spares for long journeys. Please check with your travel operator before travelling.<br>
Certain forms of transport, such as cross country trains, will require passengers to demonstrate their COVID-19 status through the “pass sanitaire”. For further details on what this involves see the ‘public spaces and services’ section below.<br>
There is no curfew in place across the French territory and there are no internal travel restrictions. You should visit the <a href=""https://www.interieur.gouv.fr/Actualites/L-actu-du-Ministere/Attestations-de-deplacement-couvre-feu"">French Interior Ministry website</a> or use the ‘TousAntiCovid’ digital app for further information. <br>
These measures may change at short notice either at national or at local level. You should check <a href=""https://www.gouvernement.fr/info-coronavirus"">local guidance</a> for further information.<br>
Full information about restrictions in France can be found <a href=""https://www.gouvernement.fr/info-coronavirus."">here</a>.<br>
*Public spaces and services: People aged 12 and over will need to demonstrate their COVID-19 status through the “pass sanitaire” in order to access services and venues. This includes leisure facilities (bars, restaurants, museums, cinemas), hospitals, retirement homes and modes of transport such as long distance train and bus journeys and planes.<br>
This can be acquired by fulfilling one of the following three criteria:<br>
1) A vaccination certificate, which conforms to the EU Digital Covid Status Certification framework, illustrating that you are fully vaccinated with a vaccine authorised by the European Medical Authority. This means:<br>
•        7 days after a second dose of Oxford/AstraZeneca, Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna<br>
•        28 days after a single dose of Johnson & Johnson<br>
•        7 days after a single injection for those able to demonstrate they have already been infected (this only applies to those vaccinated in France)<br>
2) A negative PCR or antigen result from a test taken within the last 24 hours.<br>
3) A document (dated more than 11 days ago and less than six months ago) proving you have recently recovered from COVID.<br>
The French Government has announced that from 15 December, those who are 65 and over and who have been fully vaccinated for more than six months and five weeks will need to demonstrate that they have received an approved COVID-19 booster injection in order to access the “pass sanitaire” in France.<br>
From 15 January 2022, those who are aged 18-64 years old and who have been fully vaccinated for more than seven months will need to demonstrate they have received an approved COVID-19 booster injection in order to access the “pass sanitaire” in France. This applies to visiting tourists and those residing in France. You can access the QR code for your booster in the same way as for previous injections. <br>
You can find more information on how to access the “pass sanitaire” from the <a href=""https://www.gouvernement.fr/info-coronavirus/pass-sanitaire"">French government</a>.<br>
Covid status certification that conforms with the EU Digital COVID Certification scheme (e.g. from other EU member states) can also be used for entry into settings where there is a COVID status certification requirement in France.<br>
Facemasks are mandatory in all enclosed public spaces. This applies to those aged 11 and over. It is no longer required to wear a facemask in all outdoor public spaces, with some exceptions, including gatherings, queues, markets, and stadiums. Failure to comply with these restrictions may result in a fine. Please refer to local guidance for more information.
