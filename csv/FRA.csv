Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Travel in France: Wearing masks on public transport is no longer compulsory, although some towns and cities may require mask wearing on public transport. You should check local mask rules before you travel. Wearing masks on public transport remains recommended, especially for vulnerable people.<br>
Some travel operators such as airlines may specify types of masks to be worn on board e.g. surgical masks, and may encourage you to take spares for long journeys. Please check with your travel operator before travelling. <br>
You should visit the <a href=""https://www.gouvernement.fr/info-coronavirus"">French Government Coronavirus Information page </a>or use the ‘TousAntiCovid’ digital app for further information and to stay up to date on restrictions
*Public spaces and services: From 1 August 2022, face masks are no longer mandatory in health establishments, but remain strongly recommended. Some local health authorities may still require masks, for example, Paris Hospitals (AP-HP), where masks remain mandatory for those aged 6 and above.
*Proof of vaccination: The French Government recognises vaccination certificates that conform to EU norms. This means:<br>
•        7 days after a third dose of Oxford/AstraZeneca, Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, and Novavax for domestic use (to obtain a valid “health pass”), or <br>
•        28 days after a second dose of Johnson & Johnson, or <br>
•        7 days after a second injection for those able to demonstrate they have already been infected (this only applies to those vaccinated in France) for domestic use (to obtain a valid “vaccine pass”) <br>
France will accept the proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.<br>
If your vaccine certificate e shows a different name to your passport (e.g. marital / birth name), please also carry any supporting documentation (e.g. marriage certificate) when travelling. <br>
