Some travel operators such as airlines may specify types of masks to be worn on board e.g. surgical masks, and may encourage you to take spares for long journeys. Please check with your travel operator before travelling. <br>
There are no internal travel restrictions in France, however measures may change at short notice either at national or at local level. You should visit the <a href=""https://www.gouvernement.fr/info-coronavirus"">French Government Coronavirus Information page</a> or use the ‘TousAntiCovid’ digital app for further information and to stay up to date on restrictions <br>
Public spaces and services: Face masks are mandatory on public transport and in all health establishments (hospitals, clinics, retirement homes, nursing homes and assisted living, as well as establishments for people with disabilities). <br>
Pass sanitaire (health pass): The pass sanitaire is currently required to access the following places: <br>
•        Hospitals, clinics, social/medical health care establishments <br>
•        Retirement homes, nursing homes, independent and assisted-living residences <br>
•        Establishments for people with disabilities <br>
You can find more information on requirements and how to <a href=""https://www.gouvernement.fr/info-coronavirus/pass-sanitaire"">access the “pass sanitaire” from the French Government</a>.
This can be acquired by fulfilling one of the following three criteria: <br>
1.        A vaccination certificate (see details on proof of vaccination below), or
2.        A negative PCR or antigen result from a test taken within the last 24 hours, or <br>
3.        A document (dated more than 11 days ago and less than six months ago) proving you have recently recovered from COVID. <br>

*If you test positive for coronavirus in France and you’re fully vaccinated (including a booster) you must self-isolate for 7 days from the day on which you first develop symptoms, or 7 days from the date of the positive test result. Self-isolation can be reduced to 5 days if you take a negative PCR or antigen test (supervised, not self-administered) on day 5 and you have not displayed any symptoms over the previous 48 hours. If you’re unvaccinated or partially vaccinated you must self-isolate for 10 days from the day on which you first develop symptoms, or 10 days from the date of the positive test result. Self-isolation can be reduced to 7 days if you take a negative PCR or antigen test (supervised, not self-administered) on day 7 and you have not displayed any symptoms over the previous 48 hours. <br>
You will have to extend your stay until the end of your isolation period. This could be in your current accommodation. The French authorities do not provide or pay for quarantine accommodation. <br>
