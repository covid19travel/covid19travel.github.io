Internal Restrictions: <br> 
*Travel in France: Face masks are mandatory in all enclosed public spaces. The use of face masks is mandatory in some city centres. Please check local guidance for more information. Across France, masks are still compulsory in large gatherings, queues, markets and stadiums. <br>
Wearing masks on public transport is compulsory for all users aged 11 and over, with fines for those who are not compliant. Masks are also compulsory in taxis and private hire vehicles without a plexiglass screen. <br>
Some travel operators such as airlines may specify types of masks to be worn on board e.g. surgical masks, and may encourage you to take spares for long journeys. Please check with your travel operator before travelling. <br>
Certain forms of transport, such as cross country trains, will require passengers to demonstrate their COVID-19 status through the “pass sanitaire”. For further details on what this involves see the ‘public spaces and services’ section below. <br>
There are no internal travel restrictions in France. You should visit the <a href=""https://www.interieur.gouv.fr/Actualites/L-actu-du-Ministere/Attestations-de-deplacement-couvre-feu"">French Interior Ministry website  </a> or use the ‘TousAntiCovid’ digital app for further information. <br>
These measures may change at short notice either at national or at local level. You should check <a href=""https://www.gouvernement.fr/info-coronavirus"">local guidance</a>
 for further information.
Full information about restrictions in France can be found <a href=""https://www.gouvernement.fr/info-coronavirus."">here</a>.
*Public spaces and services: From 3 January until 2 February 2022, indoor events will be limited to 2,000 people indoors and 5,000 people outdoors. <br>
Until 16 February, food or drink are not permitted in a range of venues, including cinemas, theatres, sporting venues and on transport (including long-distance journeys). Food and drink are only permitted sitting down rather than standing up in bars and cafes. Standing concerts are banned and nightclubs are closed. <br>
*Pass vaccinal: On 24 January 2022, the “pass vaccinal” (vaccine pass) entered into force, replacing the “pass sanitaire” for people aged 16 and over to demonstrate their COVID-19 vaccination status to access services and venues (for the latest list see the <a href=""https://www.gouvernement.fr/info-coronavirus/pass-vaccinal"">French government website </a>). The following proof can be used in order to obtain a ‘pass vaccinal’: <br
1.        Proof of full vaccination, including a booster dose if you’re 18 years and 1 month old (as outlined below in ‘Proof of vaccination’). <br>
2.        Proof of recovery for COVID-19, dated more than 11 days ago and less than 6 months ago. <br>
3.        Proof of a medical exemption from vaccination, including a document from your doctor to this effect. <br>
Proof of a negative test result will no longer be accepted. Those aged 12-15 will continue to be able to use a “pass sanitaire”, for which proof of a negative test will continue to be accepted. <br>
From 15 January 2022, adults who have been fully vaccinated for more than seven months need to demonstrate they have received an approved COVID-19 booster injection in order to access the “pass vaccinal” in France. From 15 February 2022, the delay for receiving a booster to maintain pass validity will reduce from seven to four months. This applies to visiting tourists and those residing in France. You can access the QR code for your booster in the same way as for previous injections. <br>
The list of places which require a pass to enter is subject to change: the latest list for the ‘pass vaccinal’ is available on the <a href=""https://www.gouvernement.fr/info-coronavirus/pass-vaccinal"">French government’s website</a>
 (in French). This currently includes, but is not limited to, leisure facilities such as restaurants, bars, museums and sport venues, including ski lifts, and long-distance transport. <br>
*Pass sanitaire: Children aged between 12 and 15 years need to continue to demonstrate their COVID-19 status through the “pass sanitaire” in order to access services and venues. This includes leisure facilities (bars, restaurants, museums, cinemas), hospitals, retirement homes and modes of transport such as long distance train and bus journeys and planes. Adults can continue to access hospitals, care homes and health and social care facilities with a negative test result. You can find more information on how to <a href=""https://www.gouvernement.fr/info-coronavirus/pass-sanitaire"">access the “pass sanitaire” from the French government </a>, including the full list of places that require a pass sanitaire to enter. <br>
This can be acquired by fulfilling one of the following three criteria:<br>
1.        A vaccination certificate (see details on proof of vaccination below). <br>
2.        A negative PCR or antigen result from a test taken within the last 24 hours. <br>
3.        A document (dated more than 11 days ago and less than six months ago) proving you have recently recovered from COVID. <br>
Children under 12 are exempt from the ‘pass sanitaire’ and the ‘pass vaccinal’. <br>
*Proof of vaccination: The French government recognises vaccination certificates, which conforms to the EU Digital Covid Status Certification framework, illustrating that you are fully vaccinated with a vaccine authorised by the European Medical Authority. This means:<br>
•        7 days after a second dose of Oxford/AstraZeneca, Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna <br>
•        28 days after a single dose of Johnson & Johnson <br>
•        7 days after a single injection for those able to demonstrate they have already been infected (this only applies to those vaccinated in France) <br>
You may also be required to have a booster dose to be able to obtain the ‘pass vaccinal’ for domestic use in France. Please see the section above for further details. <br>
France will accept the proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
Other Covid status certification that conforms with the EU Digital COVID Certification scheme (e.g. from other EU member states) can also be used for entry into settings where there is a COVID status certification requirement in France. <br>
Facemasks are mandatory in all enclosed public spaces. This applies to those aged 11 and over. It is no longer required to wear a facemask in all outdoor public spaces, with some exceptions, including gatherings, queues, markets, and stadiums. Failure to comply with these restrictions may result in a fine. Please refer to local guidance for more information. <br>
If you test positive for coronavirus in France and you’re fully vaccinated (including a booster, in line with French pass sanitaire requirements) you must self-isolate for 7 days from the day on which you first develop symptoms, or 7 days from the date of the positive test result. Self-isolation can be reduced to 5 days if you take a negative PCR or antigen test (supervised, not self-administered) on day 5 and you have not displayed any symptoms over the previous 48 hours. If you’re unvaccinated or partially vaccinated you must self-isolate for 10 days from the day on which you first develop symptoms, or 10 days from the date of the positive test result. Self-isolation can be reduced to 7 days if you take a negative PCR or antigen test (supervised, not self-administered) on day 7 and you have not displayed any symptoms over the previous 48 hours. <br>
You will have to extend your stay until the end of your isolation period. This could be in your current accommodation. The French authorities do not provide or pay for quarantine accommodation. <br>
Further information is available on the TousAntiCovid application. The French health ministry also operates a dedicated coronavirus helpline on +33 (0)800 130 000.
