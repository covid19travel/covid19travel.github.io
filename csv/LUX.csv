Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Travel in Luxembourg: In response to the rapid spread of the Omicron variant across Europe, the Luxembourg government is putting in place new measures, effective from 25 December. Face coverings must be worn on public transport and in all indoor areas open to the public and where the public is circulating. Breaches of regulations can result in fines of up to €1000.<br>
You must wear a face covering and observe the standard social distancing requirement when travelling through Luxembourg Airport (Findel). Your mask should not be removed during security control. Hand sanitiser is available throughout the terminal where hand washing is unavailable.<br>
*Accommodation: Hotel and guesthouse bars and restaurants are now open to the public under the same conditions as all other restaurants, bars and cafes (see below). Face coverings must be worn in public areas, and where the social distancing requirement cannot be met.<br>
*Public spaces and services: The government has introduced a voluntary <a href=""https://covid19.public.lu/en/covidcheck.html"">‘CovidCheck’ system</a> which allows users to demonstrate their health status, including vaccination status and COVID-19 test results. The ‘CovidCheck’ system is mandatory for restaurants, cafes and bars. Businesses can also opt in on a voluntary basis, however there is a difference to measures and restrictions for those who choose not to opt in.<br>
Face coverings must be worn in shops, supermarkets, exhibitions, and other places that are open to the public. From 25 December, restaurants and bars must close by 11pm. Customers will only be permitted entry if: (i) they have received their booster shot, or (ii) they have been vaccinated and take a rapid COVID-19 test on site which produces a negative result.<br>
Outdoor spaces and terraces must be open on three sides. Take-away, drive-through and home delivery services remain available. For private gatherings, the followings rules will apply from 25 December:<br>
•        Only vaccinated or recovered people will be permitted to gather in groups of 10 or more<br>
•        Only vaccinated or recovered people who have also provided a negative rapid COVID-19 test will be permitted to gather in groups of 20 or more. They will also need to wear masks and maintain a distance of 2 metres. Gatherings of over 100 people may only take place with special dispensation from the Ministry of Health.<br>
Luxembourg will accept the proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. However a screenshot or a photo is not sufficient. If you are travelling with a printed PDF proof of vaccination status, it must date from 1 November 2021 to ensure that the certificate can be scanned successfully, if domestic certification is required. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.<br>
Cinemas, theatres, nightclubs and cultural events are open but will be required to close by 11pm from 25 December. Shops, hairdressers and beauticians are open. Indoor sports facilities, gyms, swimming pools and aquatic centres are open with strict hygiene restrictions in place.
