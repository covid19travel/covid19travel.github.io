Non-Hungarian citizens can enter Hungary only in exceptional cases depending on the purpose of stay. <br>

been vaccinated against COVID-19 (vaccine type and manufacturer, number of doses, date of vaccination);<br>
received a negative test result, PCR or rapid antigen, with the name of the test, date and time of test, test centre and result (self-tests are not valid);<br>
recovered from COVID-19 (positive PCR test result valid for 180 days).<br>
When travelling, holders of the EU Digital COVID Certificate will have the same rights as citizens of the visited Member State who have been vaccinated, tested or recovered.<br><br>
 
Those who can prove with either a Hungarian or English language document that they have recovered from COVID-19 in the past 6 months (e.g.: PCR test results, verification by a health service provider or authority) can enter Hungary without restrictions.","Latest News: Hungarian government will impose restrictions on air travel for travelers from seven African countries (Reuters, 27.11.2021)
