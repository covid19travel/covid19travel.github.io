*Testing prior to arrival and departure: In addition to the requirement to show evidence of a negative COVID-19 test completed 72 hours before arrival in Angola, all arriving passengers are required to undergo a rapid COVID-19 test immediately on disembarkation from the plane. The cost of this is included in the airline ticket so there is no additional cost to pay at the airport. The test is undertaken in a hangar at the airport, but can take time. It usually takes approximately 20-40 minutes, depending on the number of passengers being processed, but it is advisable to carry water and a refreshment in case there is a long wait. <br>
Those receiving a negative result will be allowed entry and can continue through immigration.<br>
You will need to undertake compulsory self-quarantine for 7 days before undergoing a further COVID-19 test (but see quarantine requirements below). Those receiving a positive COVID-19 result will go immediately into mandatory quarantine at a government facility for observation and further testing. <br>
All departing passengers are required to show evidence of negative COVID-19 test completed 72 hours before departure from Angola. Angolan nationals (including dual citizens) are required to show proof of vaccination.<br>
*Quarantine requirements: On 31 August, the Angolan government announced that passengers who can show proof of a full COVID-19 vaccination (i.e. two doses) and who test negative on disembarkation will be exempt from quarantine on arrival. <br>
All other passengers without proof of a full COVID-19 vaccination (i.e. two doses) will need to undertake compulsory self-quarantine for at least 7 days once tested for COVID-19 on arrival. Returning residents who test negative on disembarkation can quarantine in their own homes. Non-resident essential workers have to quarantine in a government or government-approved facility. You must spend at least 7 days in quarantine before being tested. On arrival, health officials at the airport will issue a handout with contacts to your local health centre where you can get tested. On receipt of a negative PCR test, a Titulo De Alta (ALTA) will be issued by the health centre to authorise the end of quarantine.<br>
Those testing positive on arrival can isolate at home if asymptomatic, but those showing symptoms may be required to go into mandatory quarantine at a government facility.
