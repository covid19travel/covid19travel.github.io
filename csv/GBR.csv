Internal Restrictions: <br>
The UK government has announced that the measures put in place under plan B in England will be lifted. You should continue to follow safer behaviours to protect yourself and others: <br>
•        <a href="""">Get vaccinated</a> and get your <a href="""">booster dose</a><br>
•        Wear a face covering in most indoor public places and on public transport<br>
•        Let fresh air in if you meet indoors. Meeting outdoors is safer<br>
•        <a href="""">Get tested</a> and self-isolate if required<br>
*England: you will not be required to wear a face covering, including in communal areas of schools, but the government suggests you continue to wear one in crowded and indoor spaces where you may come into contact with people you do not normally meet. You’ll no longer need to show your NHS COVID Pass at venues and events by law. Staff and pupils in secondary schools and colleges will not be required to wear a face covering in classrooms. <br>
You are no longer asked to work from home if you can. Talk to your employer to agree arrangements to return to your workplace. 16 and 17 year olds can now book a booster dose online. Parents and guardians of people at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 between 12 to 15 years old, or those living with people at higher risk, will also be contacted to book a booster. <br>
You can stop self-isolating at the start of day 6 if you get 2 negative rapid lateral flow test results on days 5 and 6 and do not have a temperature. If either test is positive, wait until the next day before testing again. <br>
If you get a positive rapid lateral flow test result, you should isolate immediately. You no longer need to book a PCR test.
*Northern Ireland: People who test positive for COVID-19 should isolate for 10 days from their PCR test date or when symptoms started, whichever is sooner. People can end self-isolation early if they get two negative rapid lateral flow tests – one from day 6 and the second at least 24 hours later.
You should reduce social contact as much as possible by meeting in groups of no more than 3 households. Up to 6 people can meet in pubs, bars and restaurants, or up to 10 people if they’re all from the same household. Only table service is available.<br>
*Scotland: There will be no limits on how many households can meet indoors or outdoors. There will be no need for physical distancing between groups at indoor and outdoor venues including bars, restaurants, theatres, cinemas and gyms. Table service will not be needed.
Scotland: Most people will need to have had a booster dose to be recognised as fully vaccinated under the <a href=""https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-certification-scheme-information-for-customers/"">COVID certification scheme</a>. Restrictions on numbers at outdoor events are lifted. Indoor events remain limited to 100 people standing and 200 people sitting. The COVID certification scheme must be used for both outdoor and indoor events. <br>
If you’re a close contact of someone with COVID–19 and you’re fully vaccinated along with your booster dose, you can take daily rapid lateral flow tests for 7 days instead of self isolating. If you test positive or develop symptoms during this time you should self-isolate for 10 days. <br>
If you test positive for COVID-19 you should self-isolate for 10 days. You can end self-isolation early if you do not have a high temperature and get 2 negative lateral flow test results on days 6 and 7, taken at least 24 hours apart. <br>
If you do not have symptoms and get a positive rapid lateral flow test result, you must self-isolate. You do not need to take a PCR test to confirm your result. <br>
Up to 3 households can meet with 1 metre physical distancing between groups at indoor and outdoor venues like bars, restaurants, theatres, cinemas and gyms. Table service is needed if alcohol is being served.<br>
There will be no limits on how many people can meet indoors at pubs, restaurants, cinemas and theatres. Nightclubs will reopen.
*Wales: Sporting events can have crowds, with no limits on how many people can attend outdoor events. Up to 500 people can attend outdoor events. If you get a positive rapid lateral flow test result, most people will not need to take a PCR test to confirm the result. You must self-isolate immediately if you get a positive rapid lateral flow test result. People who have tested positive for COVID-19 must self-isolate for 7 full days. On days 6 and 7 they should take rapid lateral flow tests 24 hours apart. If the results are positive, they should continue to self-isolate until they get 2 negative tests, or after day 10, whichever is sooner. If they are negative they can stop self-isolating. <a href=""https://gov.wales/self-isolation"">Find out more about self-isolation on GOV.WALES</a>.
