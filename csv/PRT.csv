*The Azores: Measures are in place throughout the autonomous region of the Azores to limit the spread of the virus. There are 5 levels of risk in the Azores –

Until further notice, you should stay at home: <br>
•        On weekdays from 8pm to 5am<br>
•        On weekends from 3pm to 5am<br>
Restaurants and cafés are closed, except for food delivery and takeaways services. Shops close at 8pm during the week and at 3pm on weekends. <br>

*Inter-island travel: If you are travelling from a high or medium risk island to a low risk island, you will need to:<br>
•        show a negative RT-PCR COVID-19 test taken, at most, 72 hours before you travel, or<br>
•        take a PCR COVID-19 test on arrival, or

You will also need to 
<a href=""https://mysafeazores.com/"">complete a passenger questionnaire</a> before you depart.<br>
If you are staying for more than 7 days, you will have to repeat the test 6 days after the first test. If you are staying for more than 13 days, you will have to repeat the test 12 days after the first test. <br>
If your flight is cancelled or delayed and your PCR COVID-19 test exceeds the 72 hour timeframe, you will have to take a test on arrival and self-isolate until you receive confirmation of a negative result. <br>
This does not apply to children aged 12 and under. <br>
If you are travelling from a low risk island to another low risk island and you transit a medium or high risk island, you will not need a PCR COVID-19 test provided you remain airside throughout. <br>

You can be fined if you breach the regulations.<br>
You may be exempt from using a face mask both indoors and out on medical grounds.

You should observe strict social distancing and limit the time you spend in common areas in enclosed spaces.

<a href=""https://dre.pt/pesquisa/-/search/146435561/details/maximized"">hygiene and cleaning standards</a> and look out for the Portuguese Tourist Board’s <a href=""https://portugalcleanandsafe.com/en/stamp"">“clean and safe” certification</a>. <br>
