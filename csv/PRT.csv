•        Use a face mask in enclosed public spaces and outdoors where social distancing of 1.5 m cannot be maintained <br>
•        Wash your hands frequently and thoroughly and use a hand sanitizer where soap and water are not available <br>
•        follow any safety measures put in place by hotels, restaurants, bars and shops to reduce the risk of infection <br>
