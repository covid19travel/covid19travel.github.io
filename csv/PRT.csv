Internal Restrictions: <br>

*Public spaces and services:  <br>
-Mainland Portugal: The Portuguese government started to ease lockdown measures on 15 March. Access to public spaces and services and the right to spend time outside and move between municipalities varies according to the COVID-19 incidence rate in each municipality. Shops and other commercial premises, restaurants and cafés may have shorter trading hours. Leisure and cultural activities may be banned or limited to smaller groups. Check the restrictions in your municipality on the <a href="""">here</a> Portuguese government’s website (in Portuguese). You must wear a mask while walking along promenades and in restaurants and cafés until you are seated. The use of a mask is also obligatory on entry and exit from beaches and while using shower and changing facilities. You must maintain a social distance of 1.5m from other groups on the beach and follow the access signs. You can be fined up to €1000 if you breach the regulations. <br>
