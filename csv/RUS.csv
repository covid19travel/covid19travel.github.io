*All foreign travellers arriving in Russia: <br>
All foreign passengers should complete a travel form prior to arriving in Russia. The forms are usually handed out to passengers by cabin crew on arriving flights. The template is available at the <a href=""https://www.rospotrebnadzor.ru/upload/%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%B0%D0%90%D0%BD%D0%BA%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B0%20RUS.docx"">Rospotrebnadzor website</a> (only in Russian).<br>
The following requirements apply regardless of vaccination status. <br>
The Russian government requires all arriving foreign nationals to carry a negative COVID-19 (PCR) test result, dated within 48 hours before arrival in Russia. If a passenger arrives in Russia without a negative PCR test, they should have the test done within 48 hours from their arrival and self-isolate until they receive a negative PCR test. Airlines may have different requirements, you should check with them before travelling. <br>
Additional requirements apply to foreigners who enter Russia from the Eurasian Economic Union countries (Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan) and some CIS countries (Azerbaijan, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan) by air. Passengers arriving from these countries are required to receive a negative PCR COVID-19 test via the “Travelling without COVID-19” app and present the test result on the smartphone upon arrival. This does not apply to transit passengers travelling to Russia through the above countries. Transit passengers are required to present a certificate for a negative PCR test, with the result being within 48 hours before their arrival in Russia and a proof of travel (tickets and/or boarding passes) for the entire route. <br>
You should check the specific COVID-19 test requirements airlines have in place in advance of your flight. Airlines may refuse boarding if their requirements are not met. <br>
Testing/screening on arrival: Passengers arriving by air may be temperature-checked and/or randomly selected for additional PCR testing on arrival. No prior arrangements are required. Passengers should follow guidance of the Russian authorities upon landing. <br>

*Travelling between Russia and Belarus: <br>
By air: Foreign nationals flying to Russia from Belarus or to Belarus from Russia are subject to immigration control. If you’re transiting Russia when flying to/from Belarus, please contact the nearest Russian embassy or consulate to check if a transit visa is needed. <br>
By road: There are no immigration check points on the land border between Russia and Belarus so foreigners (including British nationals) who cross the land border between Russia and Belarus will have no stamps in their passports and will be deemed to have entered illegally. If you’re planning on driving to Russia, you’ll need to take an alternative route through a different country. <br>
By rail: If you’re planning on travelling by rail between the two countries, you should contact your train or tour operator when you make your booking to seek their advice to avoid entering Russia without passing through immigration and thus being deemed to have entered Russia illegally. You should also consider contacting your nearest Russian embassy or consulate for advice on the latest situation for rail travellers. <br>
You should make sure you have all the necessary visas for the duration of your travel.<br>
