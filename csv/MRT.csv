*Entry to Mauritania: International flights to and from Mauritania are operating. <br>
The Mauritanian authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the risk of travellers spreading COVID-19 on arrival in Mauritania. <br>
•        You must wear a face-mask on arrival <br>
•        You must complete an individual health declaration on arrival <br>
•        You will undergo a contactless temperature check on arrival. If you have a temperature upon arrival, you must agree to a PCR or rapid antigen test. While waiting for the test result you may be required to self-isolate at your own expense in a hotel or your place of residence for 10 days. If the test is negative, you can leave self-isolation before the end of the 10-day period <br>
•        You must provide proof that you have received at least two doses of a COVID-19 vaccination, of which the last dose was received at least 2 weeks before arrival, with the exception of the Johnson and Johnson vaccination for which proof is required for one dose received at least 4 weeks before arrival. <br>
•        Unvaccinated or partially vaccinated travellers to Mauritania must take a PCR test within 72 hours before arrival and show evidence of the negative test result, with the date of the test clearly labelled. You should take a private test. <br>
•        Non-Mauritanian nationals that arrive without proof of vaccination or a negative PCR test may not be allowed to enter the country and will be obliged to immediately return to their country of origin <br>
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status: Mauritania will accept the proof of COVID-19 vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered at least 14 days prior to travel and at least 4 weeks for one dose of a Johnson and Johnson vaccination. Your  appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.<br>
