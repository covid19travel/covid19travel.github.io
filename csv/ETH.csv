 International Restrictions:<br>
*All travellers: You will need a visa with a valid travel document to enter Ethiopia. <br>
*If you’re fully vaccinated: Passengers age 12 and over who have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 more than two weeks before the date of entry are required to show evidence of this. Accepted vaccinations are a single dose of Johnson and Johnson, or two doses for Astra-Zeneca, Sinopharm, Sinovac, Moderna and Pfizer. <br>
Travellers under the age of 12 do not need to show proof of vaccination.
*If you’re not fully vaccinated: If you’re not fully vaccinated, you’ll need to show proof of a negative COVID-19 RT PCR test result issued within the 72 hours (3 days) before departure, or a rapid lateral flow test up to 24 hours before arriving in Ethiopia. A lateral flow test must be certified by a testing centre and not self administered. Pre-departure tests are not required for passengers under the age of 12 or diplomats. You may need to demonstrate you have such a test certificate before boarding your flight.
You should arrange to take a private test. 
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past 90 days: If you’re not fully vaccinated but have tested positive for COVID-19 you can enter Ethiopia if you have certificate of recovery from within the last 90 days or evidence of vaccination as above.
Children and young people: Children under 12 are not required to be vaccinated or show evidence of recovery.
*If you’re transiting through Ethiopia: Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
If you are planning to travel via Ethiopia, you should be aware that restrictions apply. Transit passengers are those with an onward ticket to another destination, who do not formally enter Ethiopia. Transiting passengers are exempt from the current quarantine restrictions for COVID-19. The maximum transit time is 72 hours. <br>
While you don’t need a negative COVID-19 test to transit Addis Ababa, you should ensure that you have the correct tests for your onward journey. Check  the countries you are travelling to. Foreign nationals have previously been tested in transit and had to complete mandatory quarantine in Ethiopia after testing positive for COVID-19.
Passengers transiting for 24 hours or less can remain in the departure lounge of the airport. For transits over 24 hours, you will be taken to a designated transit hotel for the duration of your stay. On arrival in Addis Ababa Bole International Airport, you should report to the transit desk to confirm your hotel details. After health screening and immigration you will then need to present your hotel details and passport to the desk marked “transit shuttle bus” from where you will be taken to the hotel. You will not be able to leave the hotel during your transit. To the extent airline schedules allow, you should therefore minimise the duration of your transit in Addis Ababa. <br>
Passengers transiting Addis Ababa Bole International Airport are subject to COVID-19 screening measures during transit. If you have any further questions, you should contact your airline<br>
<br>
