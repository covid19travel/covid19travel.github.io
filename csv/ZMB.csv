There is no requirement for visitors or residents to self-isolate. <br>
Returning residents must have proof that they have tested negative for COVID-19 in the 72 hours before their arrival. <br>

*Testing on arrival: Anyone entering Zambia with a body temperature equal to, or above 38.0 C will be tested for COVID-19 on arrival, as will anyone with COVID-19 related symptoms. Any other arrivals may be randomly selected for testing. These tests are in addition to the requirement for visitors to show proof that they have tested negative for COVID-19 in the 72 hours before their arrival. <br>
*Quarantine requirements: If your body temperature is equal to, or above 38.0, or you have a COVID-19 related symptom (a cough, shortness of breath, a headache, loss of taste or smell, or a sore throat), you will be tested and taken to either your home or a government facility for treatment and quarantine until your tests results are known. <br>

To obtain a certificate, travellers must take their negative test result to UTH Hospital, the Zambia National Health Public Institute, the District Health Office or the Public Health Office and pay a 200 Kwacha fee. COVID-19 tests must have been taken in Zambia. <br>
