*All travellers: For Travellers to Zambia is better to be fully vaccinated but this is not mandatory. <br>
Regardless of vaccination status, you are required to complete a health declaration form and undergo thermo-scanning. If you enter Zambia with a body temperature equal to, or above 38.0 C you will be tested for COVID-19 at your expense on arrival and be required to quarantine (at your home, a hotel or government facility) until your test results are known. <br>
All travellers entering Zambia are required to adhere to the prescribed COVID-19 public health measures, summed up in the “Five Golden Rules” as follows: <br>
i) Masking up consistently and correctly in public premises; ii) Frequently washing hands with soap and water or use of alcohol based hand sanitiser; iii) Keeping physical distancing of not less than 1 metre; iv) Avoiding crowded places; v) Seeking medical attention early if feeling unwell. <br>

*If you’re fully vaccinated: If you are fully vaccinated, you can enter Zambia without providing any form of negative COVID 19 PCR test. Fully vaccinated means complete doses of a vaccine e.g. first and second dose of a two-dose COVID-19 vaccine. <br>
Proof of vaccination status: You must present proof that you have been vaccinated to qualify as fully vaccinated. Accepted evidence of proof has not been specified. The COVID Pass is expected to be accepted but you are advised to take a paper copy. <br>
*If you’re not fully vaccinated: If you are not fully vaccinated, you’ll need to show proof of a negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR test.
