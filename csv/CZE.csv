 Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Travel in the Czech Republic:  There are various measures in place to control the spread of coronavirus. The details of these measures can be found in the sections below. <br>
*Public spaces and services: It is mandatory to cover your mouth and nose in all indoor and outdoor public spaces in built up areas with a face covering of surgical mask standard or higher. In places with a high number of people, such as public transport, shopping centres and medical facilities, you are required to wear a face covering of FFP2 standard or higher (in Czech known as ‘respirátor’). The Czech government advises that people adhere to social distancing of 2m where possible when in public. <br>
From 1 March, there are restrictions on freedom of movement. You must avoid all non-essential movement. Essential shopping, exercise and travel to work are permitted within your district (‘okres’). You must not travel outside of your district (‘okres’ in Czech) unless this is for a permitted exceptional reason. Exceptions are permitted for essential travel to work, to the airport, to attend a medical appointment, or to care for an infirm relative, but you may be asked to provide written evidence of the need for your journey. Please note that the size of districts varies: the city of Prague is classed as one district. Further information on movement restrictions, including an affidavit form to confirm that a journey between districts is essential, can be found on the <a href=""https://www.mvcr.cz/mvcren/article/movement-between-districts-okresy.aspx"">Ministry of Interior website</a>. <br>
All shops and services are closed, except for pharmacies and grocery stores, which are operating with social distancing measures in place. Restaurants and bars are closed, but some offer a takeaway service. Drinking alcohol in public spaces is forbidden. <br>
All cultural venues, including museums, galleries, theatres and attractions such as zoos, are closed. <br>
The Czech Government has banned contact between people from different households. You should not leave your place of residence between 9pm and 5am unless you are travelling to, or from work, or making an essential trip. <br>
Full details of all restrictive measures in place, including permitted reasons for moving around during daytime and curfew hours, and rules on the operation of shops, can be found in English on the <a href=""https://covid.gov.cz/en/"">Czech government Covid portal</a>. Schools are closed.
