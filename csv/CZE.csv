Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Travel in the Czech Republic: There are various measures in place to control the spread of coronavirus. The details of these measures can be found in the sections below.
*Public spaces and services: It is mandatory to cover your mouth and nose with a face covering of a FFP2 standard or higher (in Czech known as ‘respirátor’) in all indoor public spaces and on public transport. The Czech government advises that people adhere to social distancing of 1.5m where possible when in public. <br>
All schools are open. Foreign nationals in need of specific information on education are advised to contact their local Czech authority. <br>
Shops and services are open and operating with social distancing measures in place. Other leisure venues (cinemas, theatres) are open with restrictive measures in place. From 1 November you will be asked to show your COVID status before entry. Full details of all restrictive measures in place including rules on organising public gatherings, operation of shops, services and restaurants can be found in English on the <a href=""https://covid.gov.cz/en/"">Czech government COVID portal</a> 
The Czech Republic will accept the proof of COVID-19 vaccination record. If you are travelling with a printed PDF proof of vaccination status, it must date from 1 November to ensure that the certificate can be scanned successfully, if domestic certification is required. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
*If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
