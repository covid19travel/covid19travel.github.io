All schools are open. UK nationals in need of specific information on education are advised to contact their local Czech authority. <br>

Other leisure venues (cinemas, theatres) are open with restrictive measures in place. From 1 November you will be asked to show your COVID status before entry. Christmas markets are closed. Full details of all restrictive measures in place including rules on organising public gatherings, operation of shops, services and restaurants can be found in English on the <a href=""https://covid.gov.cz/en/"">Czech government COVID portal</a>
