International Restrictions: <br>
*All travellers: The Government of Nepal has recently removed the requirement for travellers to complete an Online International Travel Arrival Form. When flying to Nepal from any country, you will however need to present certain documentation on arrival:
•        A Covid-19 vaccination certificate or PCR negative test result taken no more than 72 hours before the flight of first departure. These requirements do not apply to children under the age of five. Technically we understand the rule for children applies up to and including 60 months of age. Given potential ambiguity to this rule and risk of airlines interpretation, you are advised to consider the requirement applies for children once they reach the age of five. <br>
If you are vaccinated you can apply for a visa on arrival at <a href=""https://nepaliport.immigration.gov.np/on-arrival/IO01"">Online Services  </a> or complete documentation at the arrivals hall of Kathmandu Airport
You may also be asked to show proof of:<br>
•        A travel insurance document which covers health, immediate crisis, or rescue for the duration of your travel in Nepal <br>
•        Your initial hotel booking <br>
*Proof of vaccination status: Nepal will accept the proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered at least 14 days prior to travel. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
*If you’re not fully vaccinated
The Government of Nepal defines people who are fully vaccinated as those who have received full doses of an approved vaccine more than 14 days previously. If you’re not fully vaccinated, you must obtain a negative PCR test not more than 72 hours before your flight of first departure to enter Nepal, and should then be able to obtain a visa on arrival.
You are additionally required to submit the following documents when at the immigration entry point in Nepal:
•        a passport with more than six months’ validity;
•        a travel insurance document which covers health, immediate crisis, or rescue for the duration of your travel
•        You should also be ready to show evidence of your initial hotel booking.
Unvaccinated people, or those unable to show that they have been fully vaccinated for at least fourteen days, may also subject be free antigen tests on arrival. This applies to all passengers aged five years old and over.
Requirements can change at short notice, so check with your carrier and/or look for official notices to make sure you are complying with entry requirements – see the Department of Immigration’s <a href=""https://www.immigration.gov.np/"">main site</a>
