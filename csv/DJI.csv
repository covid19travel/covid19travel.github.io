International Restrictions: <br>
*All travellers: You will need a visa to enter or travel through Djibouti as a visitor. <br> 
*If you’re fully vaccinated: Even if you are fully vaccinated you will still need to arrive with a PCR test which must have been taken within 72 hours of the start of the journey and 120 hours of arrival in Djibouti. On arrival you will be required to take an additional COVID-19 test at the airport for which you will pay $30. You also need to show a Djiboutian PCR test to leave Djibouti whether or not your final destination requires this evidence. <br>
*Proof of vaccination status: You must be prepared to present proof that you have been fully vaccinated to enter Djibouti and are 25 years or older. <br>
Djibouti will accept the proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.<br>
*If you’re not fully vaccinated: If you’re not fully vaccinated or cannot show evidence of having been vaccinated, you may be required to spend 10 days in quarantine in your own accommodation. <br>

You should not eat anything 30 minutes before your arrival at the entry point. You will have to pay for the test either by credit card, but as the credit card machines do not always work, cash (dollars, euros accepted) is a more reliable method of payment. If the test result is positive, foreign travellers will have to go into quarantine, at their own expense, at a hotel agreed with those conducting the test or if showing symptoms into the hospital, until testing negative. Djiboutian nationals who test positive can choose to go to a government isolation site at no cost or pay costs of staying at a hotel. <br>
