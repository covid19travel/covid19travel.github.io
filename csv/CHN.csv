 International Restrictions:<br>
 *All travellers: Foreign nationals need a visa to enter mainland China, including Hainan Island, but not Hong Kong or Macao. Separate Travel Advice check before your trip to Hong Kong. <br>
Eligibility for visas for travel to China remains restricted. At present, visas are issued for: <br>
•        applicants who have obtained an “Invitation Letter” or “Verification Confirmation of Invitation” issued by a provincial foreign affairs office or department of commerce (M or F visa) <br>
•        applicants who have obtained a “Notification Letter of Foreigners Work Permit” (Z visa) <br>
•        applicants intending to visit a family member with a Z, M, or F visa <br>
•        applicants intending to visit a family member who is a Chinese citizen or who holds a Chinese permanent residence permit <br>
•        applicants (including dependents) who qualify for a high-level talent (R) visa <br>
•        applicants who qualify for a C visa <br>
All visa applicants aged between 14 and 70 inclusive need to make their visa application in person at a <a href=""http://www.visaforchina.org/"">Visa Application Centre</a>. As part of the application process, biometric data (scanned fingerprints) has to be provided. <br>
Biometric data may be checked/collected by the immigration authorities when entering China to register your entry to the country. <br>
If you’re issued a visa to travel from your country to China in these circumstances all travellers will need to submit a Health Declaration Certificate to your nearest Chinese Embassy or Consulate before you travel, who will need to certify your form and return it to you via email. More details, including the process for submitting forms for those still eligible, can be found on the Chinese Embassies website. <br>
It is currently not possible to apply for a visa waiver to transit through China. All travellers entering into China must comply in full with quarantine requirements; there are no exemptions to this, and transiting airside is not currently permitted. <br>
If you visit Hong Kong from the mainland of China and wish to return to the mainland, you’ll need a visa that allows you to make a second entry into China. You will also be required to comply with quarantine measures in both Hong Kong, and on your return to the mainland. <br>
It is your responsibility to check your visa details carefully. Do not overstay your visa or work illegally. The authorities conduct regular checks and you may be fined, detained or deported (or all three). <br>
If you remain in China longer than 6 months, you may need to get a Residence Permit. If you are already in China and have a visa enquiry, please contact the National Immigration Hotline: 12367 (option 2 for English). <br>
*If you’re fully vaccinated: If you’re issued a visa to travel to China all travellers will need to submit an online Health Declaration Certificate to the nearest Chinese Embassy or Consulate before you travel, who will need to certify your form and return it to you via email. Entry requirements for China are the same regardless of vaccination status.<br>
In order to receive a Health Declaration Certificate (HDC) from the Chinese Embassy, all travellers must provide evidence of one PCR test for COVID-19, with a CT value higher than 35, taken 48 hours before you travel. You can use any legal testing centre that can provide a PCR test and full report. See the <a href=""https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1085617/covid-private-testing-providers-general-testing-27-6-22.csv/preview"">list of PCR testing centres</a>.
If you transfer through a third country to China, you must ensure you have completed a PCR test within 48 hours before boarding your final flight into China. You can choose to take this test either at the city of departure OR at your transfer airport/city. After taking your PCR test, you must apply for the Health Declaration Certificate. This must be completed before boarding your final flight to China. <br>
Additional guidance on how to obtain a Health Declaration Certificate can be found on the Chinese Embassies website. <br>
*Quarantine requirements: Following health checks on arrival, you will then need to enter quarantine in a centralised facility for at least 5 days; you may be permitted to complete an additional 3 days of quarantine at home, if you have suitable accommodation. If your accommodation is not deemed suitable, the remaining days of quarantine will be in a centralised facility. All quarantine costs will be covered by the traveller. Quarantine requirements can change at short notice, may differ between provinces, and you may have to undergo further quarantine in your final destination. <br>
Follow-up tests are likely to take place throughout the quarantine period. The frequency and type of testing may differ from facility to facility. Anyone who tests positive will be moved to a designated quarantine hospital. Family members of someone who tests positive or those who have been in close contact, will likely be moved to a different quarantine facility. Family members may be split up in these circumstances. Quarantine hospital care is not covered by the Chinese government. Non-residents may be charged for their hospital care. <br>
At some points of entry, children 14 and over, will be required to quarantine alone, irrespective of whether they test positive or negative for COVID-19. <br>
You may be separated from your child if one of you tests positive for coronavirus. Whilst we cannot prevent this, if it happens to you or is about to happen, you can call +86 (0)10 8529 6600 for 24/7 urgent consular assistance. <br>
For all quarantine arrangements in China: <br>
•        you’re not allowed to leave your designated room for the duration of your quarantine and/or home isolation, unless directed by the authorities. This means you’re also unable to leave China for the duration of the quarantine; <br>
•        depending on the quarantine location, facilities may be basic: there may be no fridge, no air-conditioning, and limited or no internet/wifi; <br>
•        during your stay you will be responsible for cleaning the room; <br>
•        if meals are not available at the quarantine location, you will need to arrange food orders for delivery from outside; <br>
•        larger sized families with two parents may be separated into 2 rooms; <br>
•        if you’re on prescription medication make sure you bring enough with you to last for at least 3-4 weeks together with medical documents certifying that you need to take this medication. <br>
Failure to comply with the quarantine conditions or testing put in place, or any attempts to deliberately conceal health conditions can result in being sentenced to up to three years in prison. This applies to both Chinese and foreign nationals. <br>
After quarantine: Following quarantine, you will need to obtain a green QR health code in order to secure accommodation. In cities with lockdowns, many hotels no longer accept new guests, including those who have recently arrived into China and completed mandatory quarantine. Before arriving into China, you should ensure you have confirmed your accommodation following your mandatory quarantine. Depending on the COVID situation at the time, it can be difficult to find hotel accommodation at the end of the mandatory quarantine period. <br>
*If you’re not fully vaccinated: Travellers who are not fully vaccinated must follow the requirements outlined above in applying for a Health Declaration Certificate. You must also follow the same quarantine requirements. <br>
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year: Travellers who have had COVID-19 in the past year must follow the requirements outlined above in applying for a Health Declaration Certificate. You must also follow the same quarantine requirements.<br>
*Children and young people: Children aged 5 and under can be exempted for the pre-flight tests but are still required to apply for a Health Declaration Certificate. Children must also follow the same quarantine requirements. <br>
*If you’re transiting through a third country to arrive in China: Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination. Transiting through a third country to China is permitted. <br>
If you transfer through a third country to China, you must ensure you have completed a PCR test within 48 hours before boarding your final flight into China. You can choose to take this test either art the city of departure OR at your transfer airport/city. After taking your PCR test, you must apply for the Health Declaration Certificate. This must be completed before boarding your final flight to China. <br>
*Exemptions: There are currently no exemptions to quarantine requirements upon arrival in China. <br>
  <br>
  <br> 
Internal Restrictions: <br> 
*Travel in China: Mandatory requirements to check temperatures and use health kit apps or scan QR codes to prove travel history are in place at transport hubs, hotels, commercial buildings including restaurants, residential compounds and other locations. Restrictions on movement and quarantine arrangements remain for travel between different parts of the country. Some cities and provinces need travellers from high to medium risk areas to undergo 14 days of isolation in their place of residence or in centralised observation. Quarantine and other COVID-19 measures, including PCR tests to enter public buildings, are enforced by local authorities and vary across China, so you should check in advance. <br>
The possibility that local authorities impose mandatory lockdowns in response to fresh outbreaks is high. Such lockdowns may result in disruptions to medical and other basic services, including food delivery. You should ensure you have prepared additional food, water and medical supplies in case you are mandated to isolate at home. <br>
There have been reports of individuals who have frequented bars or restaurants where there have been confirmed cases of COVID-19 being mandated to undergo 14 days of centralised quarantine. You should keep up to date with the latest developments and this travel advice, including requirements for evidence of a negative COVID-19 NAT test within 48 hours of travel from high to medium risk areas. <br>
There have been reports of discrimination against foreign nationals in China as a result of a perceived risk that they might re-import COVID-19.","<a href=""https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/china"">Foreign travel advice, Gov.UK</a>/
