 International Restrictions:<br>
 *All travellers: Foreign nationals need a visa to enter mainland China, including Hainan Island, but not Hong Kong or Macao. <br>
*COVID-19 Entry Requirements: From 8 January 2023, China has changed its COVID-19 entry requirements for all travellers entering the country. You will need a negative PCR test within 48 hours of the arrival of your flight in China. You must submit your negative PCR test result by filling in the Health Declaration Form via the <a href=""https://htdecl.chinaport.gov.cn/htdeclweb/home/pages/healthDeclare/declare.html"">China Customs website</a> , or through the China Customs App or WeChat account. Anyone reporting a positive test result will not be permitted to board a flight to China. <br>
Passengers entering China displaying symptoms of fever, or with an abnormal Health Declaration, may be asked to undertake an antigen test on arrival. Those who test positive will be released to self-quarantine if symptoms are mild, or recommended to go to a medical institution for diagnosis and treatment if symptoms are more severe. <br>
*Children and young people: Children aged 5 and under are still required to apply for a Customs Code Health Declaration Form. <br>
*Transiting through a third country to arrive in China: Transiting through a third country to China is permitted. <br>
If you transfer through a third country to China, you must certify that you have completed a PCR test within 48 hours of your arrival in China via the China Customs website, app, or WeChat account. This must be completed before boarding your final flight to China. <br>

Internal Restrictions: <br> 
*Travel in China: Mandatory requirements to check temperatures and use health kit apps or scan QR codes to prove travel history have been lifted in most areas, but COVID-19 test results are still required for access to nursing homes, medical institutions, childcare facilities and schools. <br>
Restrictions on movement and quarantine arrangements for travel between different parts of the country have been removed, although there are reports of travel still being restricted. You should check latest developments with local authorities ahead of domestic travel, including on PCR testing requirements. <br>
If you’re planning to leave China in the near future you should regularly check with your airline for updates.
*If you test positive for COVID-19, current Chinese government advice is that you should remain at home if you’re asymptomatic or have mild symptoms. Those suffering more severe symptoms should seek medical assistance.
