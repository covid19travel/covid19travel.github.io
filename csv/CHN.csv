*COVID-19 Entry Requirements (from 8 January 2023): From 8 January 2023, China is changing its COVID-19 entry requirements for all travellers entering the country. If you are due to arrive in China on or after 8 January 2023, China time, you will need a negative PCR test. You must submit your negative PCR test result by filling in the Health Declaration Form via the <a href=""https://htdecl.chinaport.gov.cn/htdeclweb/home/pages/healthDeclare/declare.html"">China Customs website</a>, or through the China Customs App or WeChat account. Anyone reporting a positive test result will not be permitted to board a flight to China. <br>
Passengers entering China displaying symptoms of fever, or with an abnormal Health Declaration, may be asked to undertake an antigen test on arrival. Those who test positive will be released to self-quarantine if symptoms are mild, or recommended to go to a medical institution for diagnosis and treatment if symptoms are more severe.
*COVID-19 Entry Requirements (before 8 January 2023): If you are due to arrive in China before 8 January 2023 you will need to submit an online Health Declaration Certificate to the nearest Chinese Embassy or Consulate before you travel. They will need to certify your form and return it to you via email. Entry requirements for China are the same regardless of vaccination status. <br>
In order to receive a Health Declaration Certificate (HDC) from the Chinese Embassy, all travellers must provide evidence of one PCR test for COVID-19, with a CT value higher than 35, taken 48 hours before you travel. You can use any legal testing centre that can provide a PCR test and full report. <br>
If you transfer through a third country to China, you must ensure you have completed a PCR test within 48 hours before boarding your final flight into China. You can choose to take this test either at the city of departure or at your transfer airport/city. After taking your PCR test, you must apply for the Health Declaration Certificate. This must be completed before boarding your final flight to China. <br>
*Quarantine requirements on arrival (before 8 January 2023): From 8 January 2023, China is changing its entry requirements for all travellers entering the country. There will no longer be any requirement to quarantine on entry.<br>
If you are due to arrive in China before 8 January 2023, China time, the following quarantine rules still apply. <br>
Following health checks on arrival, you will then need to enter quarantine in a centralised facility for at least 5 days; you may be permitted to complete an additional 3 days of quarantine at home, if you have suitable accommodation. If your accommodation is not deemed suitable, the remaining days of quarantine will be in a centralised facility. The decision on whether quarantine is at a designated centre or if it is possible to quarantine at home rests with local authorities. All quarantine costs will be covered by the traveller. Quarantine requirements can change at short notice may differ between provinces, and you may have to undergo further quarantine in your final destination. <br>
Follow-up tests are likely to take place throughout the quarantine period. The frequency and type of testing may differ from facility to facility. Anyone who tests positive will be moved to a designated quarantine facility. Family members of someone who tests positive or those who have been in close contact, will also likely be moved. Family members may be split up in these circumstances. Quarantine care is not covered by the Chinese government. <br>
At some points of entry, children 14 and over, will be required to quarantine alone, irrespective of whether they test positive or negative for COVID-19.<br>
You may be separated from your child if one of you tests positive for coronavirus. Whilst we cannot prevent this, if it happens to you or is about to happen, you can call your consular <br>
For all quarantine arrangements in China: <br>
•        you are not allowed to leave your designated room for the duration of your quarantine and/or home isolation, unless directed by the authorities. This means you are also unable to leave China for the duration of the quarantine; <br>
•        depending on the quarantine location, facilities may be basic: there may be no fridge, no air-conditioning, and limited or no internet/wifi;<br>
•        during your stay you will be responsible for cleaning the room;
•        if meals are not available at the quarantine location, you will need to arrange food orders for delivery from outside;<br>
•        larger sized families with two parents may be separated into 2 rooms; <br>
•        if you are on prescription medication make sure you bring enough with you to last for at least 3-4 weeks together with medical documents certifying that you need to take this medication. <br>
Failure to comply with the quarantine conditions or testing put in place, or any attempts to deliberately conceal health conditions can result in being sentenced to up to three years in prison. This applies to both Chinese and foreign nationals. <br>
*After quarantine: Before arriving into China, you should ensure you have confirmed your accommodation following your mandatory quarantine (for travellers arriving in China before 8 January). Depending on the COVID-19 situation at the time, it can be difficult to find hotel accommodation. <br>
*Children and young people: Children aged 5 and under are still required to apply for a Customs Code Health Declaration Form. Children must also follow the same quarantine requirements when arriving before 8 January 2023. <br>
*Transiting through a third country to arrive in China: Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination. <br>
Transiting through a third country to China is permitted. If you transfer through a third country to China, you must ensure you have completed a PCR test within 48 hours before boarding your final flight into China. You can choose to take this test either at the city of departure OR at your transfer airport/city. After taking your PCR test, you must apply for the Customs code. This must be completed before boarding your final flight to China. <br>

  <br>
  <br> 
Internal Restrictions: <br> 
*Travel in China: Mandatory requirements to check temperatures and use health kit apps or scan QR codes to prove travel history have been lifted in most areas, but COVID-19 test results are still required for access to nursing homes, medical institutions, childcare facilities and schools.<br>
Restrictions on movement and quarantine arrangements for travel between different parts of the country have been removed, although there are reports of travel still being restricted. You should check latest developments with local authorities ahead of domestic travel, including on PCR testing requirements. <br>
The possibility that local authorities impose mandatory lockdowns in response to fresh outbreaks remains. Such lockdowns may result in disruptions to medical and other basic services, including food delivery. You should ensure you have prepared additional food, water and medical supplies in case you are mandated to isolate locally. <br>
If you are planning to leave China in the near future you should regularly check with your airline for updates, and consider that local lockdowns may have an impact on your travel plans. <br>
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are and seek treatment until you test negative. <br>
