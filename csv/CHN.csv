 <br>
 International Restrictions:<br>
 *Entry and transit: You will need a valid visa to enter China. The Chinese Visa Application Centres in many countries, are operating but with limited opening hours. <br> 
The Chinese authorities have suspended all direct flights from the UK. This measure will be subject to review but no date has been announced. Restrictions on travel to China from other countries, and the necessary requirements, may be different. Foreign nationals travelling to China from a third country should follow the directions on the website of the local Chinese Embassy or consulate for requirements from that country. <br>
If you’re issued a visa to travel to China in these circumstances you will need to submit a Health Declaration Form to your nearest Chinese Embassy or Consulate in your country before you travel, who will need to certify your form and return it to you via email. <br>
In order to receive a Health Declaration Form from the Chinese Embassy you must provide evidence of a negative nucleic acid test seven days before you travel, followed by a negative nucleic acid and an IgM antibody test for COVID-19 taken no more than 48 hours before you travel. <br>
Reports of both your nucleic acid (COVID-19) and IgM (antibody) tests must come from the same service provider. This does not mean the provider must carry out both tests, but that the provider must guarantee both test reports. You should arrange to take a private test from one of the eligible providers listed on the <a href=""https://www.mfa.gov.cn/ce/ceuk/eng/visa/jiankangmaEn/t1854940.htm""> Embassy website</a>.
A limited number of international flights from other countries are flying into Beijing. Other international passenger flights to Beijing continue to be diverted to 16 designated airports in Chengdu, Changsha, Hefei, Lanzhou, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, Hohhot, Jinan, Qingdao, Nanjing, Shenyang, Dalian, Zhengzhou, Xi’an and Wuhan. A small number of international flights are also operating direct between European cities and Shanghai, Guangzhou and Qingdao. <br>
Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status: China has not yet confirmed that it will accept the solutions for demonstrating your COVID vaccination status. You should follow guidance for alternative entry requirements. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination. <br>
Health checks on arrival: All international arrivals will be subject to PCR testing on arrival, during and after quarantine. Even asymptomatic carriers will be isolated in a Covid hospital until they return at least three consecutive negative results. There have been some cases of individuals testing intermittently positive for a number of weeks. Travellers with a history of COVID-19 infection should consider leaving a gap between an infection and travel to China. All travellers should take precautions before and during travel to minimise as far as possible the chances of testing positive on arrival. <br>
Health regulations surrounding passengers arriving from overseas are continuously changing. You should contact the Chinese embassies before you travel if you have any questions regarding these entry requirements, quarantine rules or the requirements for individual cities. <br>
Quarantine requirements: Following health checks on arrival, you will then need to enter quarantine for at least 14 days. At some points of entry children 14 and over will be required to quarantine alone irrespective of whether they test positive or negative for COVID. <br>
You may be separated from your child if one of you tests positive for coronavirus. Whilst we cannot prevent this, if it happens to you or is about to happen, you can call your consular assistance. Non-residents may be charged for their care.<br> 
Quarantine is usually spent at either a centralised government hotel (with costs covered by the traveller) or your home. Quarantine requirements can change at short notice and may differ from province to province. <br>
Follow-up swab tests are likely to take place during your quarantine period. Family members of someone who tests positive, or those who have been in close contact, will need to go into a government quarantine hospital.<br>
For all quarantine arrangements in China: <br>
•        unless directed by the authorities you’re not allowed to leave your designated quarantine location for 14 days. This means you’re also unable to leave China for the duration of the quarantine <br>
•        depending on the quarantine location, facilities may be basic: there may be no fridge, no air-conditioning, and limited or no internet/wifi <br>
•        during your stay you will be responsible for cleaning the room<br>
•        if meals are not available at the quarantine location, you will need to arrange food orders for delivery from outside <br>
•        larger sized families with two parents may be separated into 2 rooms. <br>
•        if you’re on prescription medication make sure you bring enough with you to last for at least 3-4 weeks together with medical documents certifying that you need to take this medication. <br>
Failure to comply with the quarantine conditions or testing put in place, or any attempts to deliberately conceal health conditions can result in being sentenced to up to three years in prison. This applies to both Chinese and foreign nationals. <br>
After quarantine: Following quarantine, you will need to obtain a green QR health code in order to secure accommodation. In cities with lockdowns, many hotels no longer accept new guests, including those who have recently arrived into China and completed mandatory quarantine. Before arriving into China, you should ensure you have confirmed your accommodtion following your mandatory quarantine <br>
  <br>
  <br> 
Internal Restrictions: <br> 
*Travel in China: Mandatory requirements to check temperatures and use health kit apps or scan QR codes to prove travel history are in place at transport hubs, hotels, commercial buildings including restaurants, residential compounds and other locations. Restrictions on movement and quarantine arrangements remain for travel between different parts of the country. Some cities and provinces need travellers from high to medium risk areas to undergo 14 days of isolation in their place of residence or in centralised observation. Quarantine is enforced at the neighbourhood level and procedures vary, so check in advance.<br>
The possibility that local authorities impose mandatory lockdowns in response to fresh outbreaks is high. Such lockdowns may result in disruptions to medical and other basic services, including food delivery. You should ensure you have prepared additional food, water and medical supplies in case you are mandated to isolate at home. There have been reports of individuals who have frequented bars or restaurants where there have been confirmed cases of COVID-19 being mandated to undergo 14 days of centralised quarantine. You should keep up to date with the latest developments and this travel advice, including requirements for evidence of a negative COVID-19 NAT test within 48 hours of travel from high to medium risk areas. <br>
There have been reports of discrimination against foreign nationals in China as a result of a perceived risk that they might re-import COVID-19.<br>
