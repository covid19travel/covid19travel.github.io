Further health screening is in place at VC Bird International Airport and the private jet terminal for all international arrivals. The measures are subject to change but may include mandatory temperature, travel history checks, a check on whether your accommodation is on the <a href=""https://visitantiguabarbuda.com/antigua-and-barbuda-is-open/"">Government of Antigua and Barbuda’s Approved List</a>, completion of a Health Declaration Form and further testing for Coronavirus.

All Marine Pleasure Craft and Ferry Services entering the waters of Antigua and Barbuda should contact the Antigua Port Authority, using VHF Channel 16, at least six (6) hours prior to arrival.

*Quarantine requirements: On arrival, you will be subject to health screening. The Ministry of Health and Wellness of Antigua and Barbuda advise that all arrivals will be monitored for coronavirus for up to 14 days and that ultimately it is the decision of the Quarantine Authority on who must self-isolate or quarantine on arrival. <br>
In practice, tourists arriving with pre-booked hotel accommodation from the <a href=""https://visitantiguabarbuda.com/antigua-and-barbuda-is-open/"">Government of Antigua and Barbuda’s Approved List</a> will normally be permitted to travel to their accommodation after screening and be allowed to move around the country providing they adhere to local social distancing measures. <br>
Visitors staying with family, friends, in private accommodation, in their own place of residence, or other location not on the <a href=""https://visitantiguabarbuda.com/antigua-and-barbuda-is-open/"">Government of Antigua and Barbuda’s Approved List</a> will be subject to an interview to determine suitability to leave for their accommodation arrangements. Those permitted to self-isolate in their accommodation will have to do so for a period up to 14 days and may be required to wear a quarantine bracelet to ensure compliance. <br>
Residents, who have received their full COVID-19 vaccination cycle will be required to quarantine or self-isolate for up to seven days. The Health Authorities will make arrangements to test returning residents on day five. As soon as a negative result is confirmed the resident will be released from quarantine or self-isolation. A person is considered fully vaccinated two weeks after receiving their second dose (for vaccines requiring two doses) or two weeks after receiving their only vaccination (for those vaccines which require one dose). <br>
Regardless of whether they have been vaccinated, residents and visitors not deemed to have suitable accommodation arrangements will be obliged to remain in government quarantine at their expense for the period directed by the Quarantine Authority up to a period of 14 days. The fee is XCD 100 per day. <br>
Failure to comply with any order, guideline or direction of the Quarantine Authority or other health authorities is considered an offence carrying a fine of up to XCD 10,000 and/or six months imprisonment. <br>
